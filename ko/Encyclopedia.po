"Aasimars are humans with a significant amount of celestial or other good outsider blood in their ancestry. While not always benevolent, aasimars are more inclined toward acts of kindness rather than evil, and they gravitate toward faiths or organizations associated with celestials. Aasimar heritage can lie dormant for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently human parents. Most societies interpret aasimar births as good omens, though it must be acknowledged that some aasimars take advantage of the reputation of their kind, brutally subverting the expectations of others with acts of terrifying cruelty or abject venality. \"It's always the one you least suspect\" is the axiom these evil aasimars live by, and they often lead double lives as upstanding citizens or false heroes, keeping their corruption well hidden. Thankfully, these few are the exception and not the rule.\n"
"<b>Physical Description:</b>\n"
"Aasimars look mostly human except for some minor physical trait that reveals their unusual heritage. Typical aasimar features include hair that shines like metal, jewel-toned eyes, lustrous skin color, or even glowing, golden halos.\n"
"<b>Society:</b>\n"
"Aasimars cannot truly be said to have an independent society of their own. As an offshoot of humanity, they adopt the societal norms around them, though most find themselves drawn to those elements of society that work for the redress of injustice and the assuagement of suffering. This sometimes puts them on the wrong side of the law in more tyrannical societies, but aasimars can be careful and cunning when necessary, able to put on a dissembling guise to divert the attention of oppressors elsewhere. While corrupt aasimars may be loners or may establish secret societies to conceal their involvement in crime, righteous aasimars are often found congregating in numbers as part of good-aligned organizations, especially (though not always) churches and religious orders.\n"
"<b>Relations:</b>\n"
"Aasimars are most common and most comfortable in <link=\"Encyclopedia:Humans\"><b>human</b></link> communities. This is especially true of those whose lineage is more distant and who bear only faint marks of their heavenly ancestry. It is unclear why the touch of the celestial is felt so much more strongly in humanity than other races, though it may be that humanity's inherent adaptability and affinity for change is responsible for the evolution of aasimars as a distinct race. Perhaps the endemic racial traits of other races are too deeply bred, too strongly present, and too resistant to change. Whatever dalliances other races may have had with the denizens of the upper planes, the progeny of such couplings are vanishingly rare and have never bred true. However, even if they generally tend toward human societies, aasimars can become comfortable in virtually any environment. They have an easy social grace and are disarmingly personable. They get on well with <link=\"Encyclopedia:Half-elves\"><b>half-elves</b></link>, who share a similar not-quite-human marginal status, though their relations are often less cordial with <link=\"Encyclopedia:Half-orcs\"><b>half-orcs</b></link>, who have no patience for aasimars' overly pretty words and faces. <link=\"Encyclopedia:Elves\"><b>Elven</b></link> courtiers sometimes dismiss aasimars as unsophisticated, and criticize them for relying on natural charm to overcome faux pas. Perhaps of all the known races, <link=\"Encyclopedia:Gnomes\"><b>gnomes</b></link> find aasimars most fascinating, and have an intense appreciation for their varied appearances as well as the mystique surrounding their celestial heritage.\n"
"<b>Alignment and Religion:</b>\n"
"Aasimars are most often of <link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\"><b>good</b></link> alignment, though this isn't necessarily universal, and aasimars that have turned their back on righteousness may fall into an unfathomable abyss of depravity. For the most part, however, aasimars favor deities of honor, valor, protection, healing, and refuge, or simple and prosaic faiths of home, community, and family. Some also follow the paths of art, music, and lore, finding truth and wisdom in beauty and learning.\n"
"<b>Adventurers:</b>\n"
"Aasimars frequently become adventurers, as they often do not quite feel at home in human society and feel the pull of some greater destiny. Clerics, oracles, and paladins are most plentiful in their ranks, though bards, sorcerers, and summoners are not uncommon among those with a fondness for arcane magic. Aasimar barbarians are rare, but when born into such tribes they often rise to leadership and encourage their clans to embrace celestial totems.\n"

"Abadar is a patient, calculating, and far-seeing deity who wishes to bring civilization to the frontiers, order to the wilds, and wealth to all who support the rule of law. His primary desire is to see the purifying spread of civilization, enlightening the dark corners of the world and revealing the clockwork perfection of the cosmos. His nature is not hasty, for the pace of society's reach is slow but relentless. He strikes a careful balance between good and evil, seeing benefits on both sides and refusing to endorse one or the other. His followers believe he is responsible for elevating the various humanoid races from simple tribes to beings capable of creating huge cities. He puts words of diplomacy in the mouths of leaders, guides the pens of those who write laws, and steers coins into the hands of those who practice fair commerce.\n"
"The god of cities is stern, but rewards those who work hard and whose actions benefit others as well as themselves, though he is morally ambiguous enough to recognize that not every person can benefit from every decision. He frowns on the misuse of slaves or beasts of burden, considering it a waste of resources and detrimental to the profitability of civilization as a whole; he views using cheap laborers rather than slaves as a better option, as then the workers can use their funds to participate in commerce and rise above their low station through established economic channels. Abadar understands, however, that the world changes in small increments, and that the most advantageous option for society is not always the most workable in the present. He respects cautious thought and rejects impulsiveness, seeing it as a base and destructive whim. He teaches that discipline, keen judgment, and following the law eventually lead to wealth, comfort, and happiness. He does not believe in free handouts, and because of this his temples sell potions and healing spells or scrolls rather than giving them to those in need. Any who protest are directed to the temple of Sarenrae.\n"
"Abadar is the master and guardian of the First Vault, a magical trove in his realm where a perfect version of every type of creature and object exists — a perfect sword, a perfect deer, a perfect wheel, and even a perfect law. His mortal artists and artisans attempt to emulate these perfect forms, inspired by Abadar's mentoring. Likewise, his arbiters and judges keep these idealized laws in mind when crafting new laws or ruling on existing ones. It is said that centuries ago Abadar allowed mortals to visit the First Vault in dreams, the better to inspire them. There has been no record of such coveted visions occurring in a long time, however, perhaps because he has not found someone worthy, because he fears his enemies might steal the perfect forms, or because he is carefully pacing the advance of current civilizations to prevent them from growing too quickly and dissolving before they reach their peak.\n"
"His primary worshipers are aristocrats, artisans, judges, lawyers, merchants, and politicians, all of whom benefit from established laws and commerce. Those who are poor or who have been wronged also worship him, praying he might help reverse their ill fortune, for most mortals seek wealth and the happiness it brings. He expects his followers to abide by local laws (though not foolish, contradictory, toothless, or purposeless mandates) and to work to promote order and peace. He has no tolerance for gambling or excessive drinking or drug use, as despite the lucrative nature of these industries, such vices inevitably weaken society rather than strengthen it.\n"
"Worshipers who lose Abadar's favor might find themselves short on money at a crucial time, tongue-tied in the middle of an important deal, or stymied in their craft or art. When he is pleased, deals are more profitable than expected, projects are completed early, and journeys to or within a city take less time than normal. His intervention in the mortal world is subtle, for he expects worshipers to do their own work; it usually takes the form of hints or opportunities rather than direct gifts.\n"
"Abadar is depicted as a handsome man with black hair dressed in fine garments, often with a gold cloak over a golden breastplate and bearing many keys. <link=\"Encyclopedia:Humans\"><b>Humans</b></link>, <link=\"Encyclopedia:Dwarves\"><b>dwarves</b></link>, and <link=\"Encyclopedia:Gnomes\"><b>gnomes</b></link> show him with a beard, whereas <link=\"Encyclopedia:Elves\"><b>elves</b></link> show him beardless and with long braids tied with golden thread. His voice is pleasant and even, his words firm but not harsh.\n"
"Abadar's holy symbol is a <b>golden key</b>, often with a city image on the head. His clergy is made up almost entirely of clerics, with a small number of paladins. Because of the emphasis on cities and civilization, he almost never has adepts among his priesthood — even the most remote settlements paying homage to Abadar are watched over by at least a cleric or a paladin. He is called the Master of the First Vault, Judge of the Gods, and the Gold-Fisted.\n"

"아바다르는 인내심 깊고 계획적이며, 미래를 내다보는 신으로, 변경 지역에 문명을, 야생에 질서를, 법규를 지키는 자들에게 부를 가져다 주는 신입니다. 그의 가장 주된 바람은 문명이 확장되어 어두운 변경의 불을 밝히고, 시계태엽처럼 돌아가는 조화의 완벽함이 드러나는 모습을 바라보는 것입니다. 그의 본성은 서두르는 법이 없습니다. 사회가 구성되는 속도는 느릴지라도, 그 흐름에는 멈춤이 없기 때문입니다. 그는 선과 악 사이의 균형을 신중하게 유지하며, 양쪽 모두의 장단을 인정하고, 어느 한쪽만을 지지하지 않으려합니다. 그의 추종자들은 여러 인간형 종족들이 단순한 부족 사회를 벗어나 커다란 도시를 만들 수 있게 된 것은 그의 인도 덕분이었다고 믿고 있습니다. 그는 지도자의 말에 외교적인 단어들이 머물게끔 하고, 법을 쓰는 자들의 펜을 인도하며, 공정한 상업에 종사하는 자들의 손에 이익이 들어가게끔 만듭니다.\n"
"도시들의 신은 근엄한 존재이지만, 열심히 일하는 자들, 자신만이 아니라 남에게도 이득을 가져다주는 행동을 하는 자들에게는 은총을 베풉니다. 비록 그의 모호한 도덕적 성향은, 모든 이들이 모든 선택에서 혜택을 받을 수 없다는 사실을 잘 알고 있지만 말입니다. 그는 노예나 짐을 나르는 짐승들을 함부로 다루는 것을 못마땅하게 여깁니다. 왜냐하면 그것은 자원의 낭비이고, 문명이 얻을 수 있는 이익을 저해시키기 때문입니다. 그는 노예를 이용하는 것보다 저임금의 노동자를 이용하는 것이 더 나은 선택이라고 여깁니다. 노동자들은 그들이 번 돈을 사용해 경제생활에 참여할 것이고, 그로 인해 생성된 경제적 기반을 통해 그들의 빈약한 삶 또한 나아질 수 있을 것입니다. 그러나 아바다르는 세계가 느리게 변화한다는 사실을 이해하고 있고, 사회에 가장 이로운 선택조차 언제나 실행에 옮길 수 있는 것은 아니란 사실도 잘 알고 있습니다. 그는 신중한 사고를 존중하며, 충동적인 변화는 야비하고 파괴적인 변덕에 지나지 않는다고 생각하며 거부합니다. 그는 이런 규율과 날카로운 판단, 질서를 따르는 것이야말로 결국 풍요와 평안, 행복으로 이어질 것이라고 가르칩니다. 그는 무상 지원을 믿지 않기 때문에, 그의 신전은 물약이나 치유 주문 혹은 두루마리 등을 필요로 하는 사람에게 무상으로 제공하기보다는 판매하려고 합니다. 이에 거부감을 느끼는 자들은 세어렌레이의 신전으로 향합니다.\n"
"아바다르는 그의 왕국에 있는 시초의 금고(the First Vault)라는 유물의 주인이자 수호자입니다. 이 안에는 모든 생명체와 물체들의 이상적인 형태가 존재한다고 합니다. 완벽한 검, 완벽한 사슴, 완벽한 수레바퀴, 심지어는 완벽한 법까지 말입니다. 그를 숭배하는 필멸자 예술가와 장인들은 아바다르가 주는 영감을 통해 이 완벽한 형태를 모방하고자 노력합니다. 마찬가지로 그의 조정자와 법관들은 새로운 법을 만들거나 기존의 법에 대한 판결을 내릴 때 그 이상적인 법들을 염두에 둡니다. 전해지는 말에 따르면 수백 년 전 아바다르는 필멸자들에게 영감을 불어넣기 위해, 그들이 꿈을 통해 시초의 금고에 발을 들일 수 있도록 허락한 적이 있다고 합니다. 그러나 이 모두가 갈망할만한 오래전의 계시에 대한 기록은 남아 있지 않다고 합니다. 아마도 그는 합당한 자격을 지닌 자를 찾지 못했거나, 그의 적들이 이 완벽한 형태를 훔칠 것을 두려워했던 것 같습니다. 혹은 현재의 문명이 너무 빨리 발전해, 그 절정에 채 도달하기 전에 무너지지 않게끔 진보의 속도를 조금씩 조절하기 위해서였을지도 모릅니다.\n"
"그를 믿는 대부분의 신자는 귀족이나 장인, 법관, 변호사, 상인, 정치가와 같이 확립된 법과 상업을 통해 이득을 얻을 수 있는 자들입니다. 가난하거나 학대받던 자들 역시 그를 숭배하며, 자신들의 불행을 떨쳐버릴 수 있게 해달라고 기도합니다. 대부분의 필멸자들이 그가 가져다주는 부와 행복을 추구하기 때문입니다. 그는 자기의 추종자들이 지역 사회의 법(비록 바보스럽거나 모순적이거나 기강이 없고 무의미한 통치여선 안 되지만)을 준수하도록 바라며, 질서와 평화를 증진하기 위해 일할 것을 기대합니다. 그는 도박이나 무분별한 음주, 마약에 대해서는 절대 관용을 보이지 않습니다. 비록 이것들은 수익성이 좋은 사업이긴 하지만, 결국 사회의 진보를 막고 약화시킬 것이기 때문입니다.\n"
"아바다르의 호의를 잃은 추종자들은 결정적인 시기에 돈이 부족해지거나 중요한 거래에서 말문이 막힌다거나 공예나 예술 활동에 있어 좌절을 겪게 될 것입니다. 반대로 그가 만족할 경우 기대했던 것보다 더 많은 이익을 얻고, 계획이 일찍 완수되고, 여행을 떠나거나 도시를 돌아다녀도 더 적은 시간이 걸리게 될 것입니다. 그가 필멸자의 세상에 관여하는 일은 잘 보이지 않게 이루어집니다. 그는 추종자들이 스스로 움직이기를 원하기 때문입니다. 그러므로 그의 호의는 직접적인 선물보다는 작은 실마리나 기회의 형태를 가지는 경우가 더 흔합니다.\n"
"아바다르는 주로 금으로 만들어진 흉갑 위에 황금색의 망토를 두르고 수많은 열쇠를 몸에 찬 잘생긴 검은 머리의 남성으로 그려집니다. <link=\"Encyclopedia:Humans\"><b>인간</b></link>, <link=\"Encyclopedia:Dwarves\"><b>드워프</b></link>, <link=\"Encyclopedia:Gnomes\"><b>노움</b></link>들은 수염을 기른 모습으로 그를 그려내며, <link=\"Encyclopedia:Elves\"><b>엘프</b></link>들은 수염이 없고 황금 실로 묶인 긴 장식용 수술을 단 모습으로 그립니다. 그의 목소리는 상냥하면서 차분하고, 그의 말은 단호하지만 가혹하진 않습니다.\n"
"아바다르의 신성한 상징은 황금 열쇠로, 주로 그 윗부분에 도시의 모습이 그려져 있습니다. 그의 성직자들은 거의 모두가 클레릭으로 구성되어 있으며 소수의 팔라딘이 있습니다. 도시와 문명을 중요시하기 때문에 그는 자신의 사제단에 정식적인 성직 교육을 받지 않은 수행 사제를 결코 받아들이지 않습니다. 심지어 아바다르에게 경의를 표하는 아주 멀리 떨어진 정착지라 해도 최소한 한 명의 클레릭이나 팔라딘이 그 지역을 관리합니다. 그는 시초의 금고의 주인(the Master of the First Vault), 신들의 법관(the Judge of the Gods), 거머쥔 황금의 손(the Gold-Fisted) 등으로 불립니다.\n"

"<b>Bomb</b>\n"
"In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are adept at swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Intelligence\"><b>Intelligence</b></link> modifier.\n"
"Thrown bombs have a range of 30 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, an alchemist's bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. The damage of an alchemist's bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a <link=\"Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw\"><b>Reflex save</b></link> for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.\n"
"<b>Mutagen</b>\n"
"At 1st level, an alchemist discovers how to create a mutagen that he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of his personality.\n"
"It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes the alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting him a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 10 minutes per alchemist level. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist takes a –2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Strength\"><b>Strength</b></link>, it applies a penalty to his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Intelligence\"><b>Intelligence</b></link>.

"<b>Discovery</b>\n"
"At 2nd level, and then again, every 2 levels thereafter (up to 18th level), an alchemist makes an incredible alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, an alchemist cannot select an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries can only be made if the alchemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as uncovering other discoveries. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any saving throw called for by a discovery is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.\n"
"<b>Poison Resistance</b>\n"
"At 2nd level, an alchemist gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and then again to +6 at 8th level. At 10th level, an alchemist becomes completely immune to poison.\n"

"<b>Selectable Features</b>\n"
"<b>Acid Bomb</b>\n"
"When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict acid damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from an acid bomb take an additional 1d6 points of acid damage 1 round later.\n"
"Prerequisite: Bomb\n"
"<b>Blinding Bombs</b>\n"
"When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose for it to detonate very brightly. Creatures that take a direct hit from a blinding bomb are blinded for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves against the bomb are dazzled for 1 minute.\n"
"Prerequisite: Alchemist 8, Bomb\n"
"<b>Breath Weapon Bomb</b>\n"
"Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb, the alchemist can draw the components, drink them, mix them within his body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone and has the same DC as the bomb. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit from the alchemist's bomb, but succeeding at a <link=\"Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw\"><b>Reflex save</b></link> (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligent modifier) halves the damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n"
"Prerequisite: Alchemist 6, Bomb\n"
"<b>Choking Bomb</b>\n"
"Instead of dealing damage this bomb exposes creatures around it to choking gas. Everyone around target must succeed on a Fortitude save or become Nauseated for 1 round per 1d6 damage that alchemist bombs usually inflict. Targets that were Nauseated by this bomb can attempt another save each round.\n"
"Prerequisite: Bomb\n"
"<b>Cognatogen</b>\n"
"The alchemist gains the ability to create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability score. If the cognatogen enhances his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Intelligence\"><b>Intelligence</b></link>, it applies a penalty to his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Strength\"><b>Strength</b></link>. If it enhances his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Wisdom\"><b>Wisdom</b></link>, it applies a penalty to his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Dexterity\"><b>Dexterity</b></link>. If it enhances his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Charisma\"><b>Charisma</b></link>, it applies a penalty to his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Constitution\"><b>Constitution</b></link>. Otherwise, this ability works just like the mutagen ability (including the natural armor bonus). Anytime the alchemist would prepare a mutagen, he may instead prepare a cognatogen. All limitations of mutagens apply to cognatogens as if they were the same substance — an alchemist can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen at a time, a cognatogen that is not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes a non-alchemist sick, and so on. When the effect of the cognatogen ends, the alchemist takes 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens.\n"
"<b>Grand Cognatogen</b>\n"
"The alchemist's cognatogen now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +8 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second mental ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a third mental ability score. The alchemist takes a –2 penalty to his Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as long as the cognatogen persists, and takes 2 points of ability damage to each physical ability score when the cognatogen ends.\n"
"<b>Greater Cognatogen</b>\n"
"The alchemist's cognatogen now grants a +4 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), and a +4 alchemical bonus to a second mental ability score. The alchemist takes a –2 penalty on both associated physical ability scores as long as the mutagen persists, and takes 2 points of ability damage to both associated physical ability scores when the cognatogen ends.\n"
"<b>Cursed Bomb</b>\n"
"When an alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deliver one of the four powerful curses. A creature that takes a direct hit from a cursed bomb must succeed at a Will save or be affected by one of the following curses:\n"
"Curse of Feeble Body — the subject suffers a -6 decrease to Constitution score.\n"
"Curse of Weakness — the subject suffers a -6 decrease to Strength and Dexterity scores.\n"
"Curse of Idiocy — the subject suffers a -6 decrease to Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores.\n"
"Curse of Deterioration — the subject suffers a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks.\n"
"<b>Dispelling Bomb</b>\n"
"When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it dispel magic effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted dispel magic spell, using the alchemist's level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect.\n"
"<b>Explosive Bombs</b>\n"
"The alchemist's bombs now have a splash radius of 10 feet rather than 5 feet (see <link=\"Encyclopedia:Throw_Splash_Weapon\"><b>Throw Splash Weapon</b></link>). Creatures that take a direct hit from an explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished.\n"
"<b>Feral Mutagen</b>\n"
"Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. These are primary attacks and are made using the alchemist's full base attack bonus. The claw attacks deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the alchemist is Small) and the bite attack deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if the alchemist is Small). While the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist gains a +2 competence bonus on Persuasion skill checks made to intimidate.\n"
"<b>Force Bomb</b>\n"
"When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict force damage. Force bombs deal 1d4 points of force damage, plus 1d4 points of force damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a force bomb are knocked prone unless they succeed on a Reflex save.\n"
"<b>Grand Mutagen</b>\n"
"The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +8 alchemical bonus to one ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a third physical ability score. The alchemist takes a –2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as long as the mutagen persists.\n"
"<b>Greater Mutagen</b>\n"
"The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +4 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), and a +4 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score. The alchemist takes a –2 penalty on both associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists.\n"
"<b>Holy Bombs</b>\n"
"When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal good divine damage. Evil creatures that take a direct hit from a holy bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, holy bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Holy bombs have no effect on good-aligned creatures.\n"
"<b>Infusion</b>\n"
"Infusion discovery allows an alchemist to use his extracts not only on himself but on other people as well. With this discovery, all alchemist extracts will behave exactly like spells with same names when considering targets and range.\n"
"<b>Precise bomb</b>\n"
"When the alchemist throws a bomb, he doesn't affect allies.\n"
"<b>Spontaneous Healing</b>\n"
"The alchemist gains the ability to heal from wounds rapidly. As a free action once per round, he can heal 5 hit points as if he had the fast healing ability. He can heal 5 hit points per day in this manner for every 2 alchemist levels he possesses.\n"
"<b>Tanglefoot Bombs</b>\n"
"A creature that takes a direct hit from a tanglefoot bomb must save against the bomb's DC or be entangled and glued to the floor as if it had failed its save against a tanglefoot bag. Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves are entangled but not glued to the floor; those who make this save are not entangled at all."

"Whether secreted away in a smoky basement laboratory or gleefully experimenting in a well-respected school of magic, the alchemist is often regarded as being just as unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous as the concoctions he brews. While some creators of alchemical items content themselves with sedentary lives as merchants, providing tindertwigs and smokesticks, the true alchemist answers a deeper calling. Rather than cast magic like a spellcaster, the alchemist captures his own magic potential within liquids and extracts he creates, infusing his chemicals with the virulent power to grant him impressive skill with poisons, explosives, and all manner of self-transformative magic.\n"
"<b>Role</b>: The alchemist's reputation is not softened by his exuberance (some would say dangerous recklessness) in perfecting his magical extracts and potion-like creations, infusing these substances with magic siphoned from his aura and using his own body as experimental stock. Nor is it mollified by the alchemist's almost gleeful passion for building explosive bombs and discovering strange new poisons and methods for their use. These traits, while making him a liability and risk for most civilized organizations and institutions of higher learning, seem to fit quite well with most adventuring groups.\n"

"The swordlords follow no singular path to dueling mastery-some of those who take up the blade only dabble in its use, while others explore swordplay with the dueling weapon in unconventional ways. But those who seek to most closely emulate these traditions usually do so by taking levels in this prestige class. When one hears of an swordlord traveling the back roads, confronting bandits and defeating braggarts by challenging them to single combat, that swordlord has very likely pursued this path.\n"
"Due to this prestige class's emphasis on mastering numerous feats, swordlords often have levels in the fighter class; many of these are humans with above-average intelligence, which helps them swiftly fulfill the skill requirements, but this is far from the only route available. Rangers, rogues, and slayers also seek to master this signature sword-fighting art by gaining levels as an swordlord, even though, in most cases, they must wait longer to qualify for the class than fighters.\n"
"<b>Class Details</b>\n"
"<b>Hit Die:</b> d10.\n"
"<b>Requirements</b>\n"
"To qualify to become an Aldori swordlord, a character must fulfill all the following criteria:\n"
"<b>Feats:</b> Dazzling Display, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (dueling sword), Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (dueling sword).\n"
"<b>Skills:</b> Knowledge (World) 3 ranks, Mobility 3 ranks, Perception 5 ranks, Persuasion 5 ranks.\n"
"<b>Class Skills</b>\n"
"The Aldori swordlord's class skills are Knowledge (World), Mobility, Perception\tand Persuasion.\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Adaptive Tactics</b>\n"
"At 4th level, an Aldori swordlord learns to adapt his fighting style to counter his enemy's strengths. An Aldori swordlord reduces the attack roll penalty for fighting defensively or using Combat Expertise by 1 at 4th level and by 2 at 8th level.\n"
"In addition, after a creature attacks an Aldori swordlord for the first time, he attempts a Perception check (DC = 10 + the opponent's base attack bonus). If successful, the Aldori swordlord gains a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls and to his AC against that creature until the end of combat.\n"
"<b>Confounding Duelist</b>\n"
"At 10th level, the penalty from Aldori swordlord's shatter confidence increases to -2. The target also loses all insight and competence bonuses to these checks.\n"
"<b>Defensive Parry</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, an Aldori swordlord gains a +1 bonus to his AC against melee attacks when making a full attack with a dueling sword. This AC bonus increases to +2 at 7th level. If an Aldori swordlord is also a fighter with the Aldori defender fighter archetype, levels in this class stack with his fighter levels when determining the AC bonus from this ability.\n"
"<b>Deft Strike</b>\n"
"An Aldori swordlord can add his Dexterity bonus (if any) to damage rolls made with a dueling sword instead of his Strength bonus. This bonus on damage rolls applies whether the swordlord is wielding a dueling sword one-handed or two-handed. Aldori swordlord cannot use this ability if he is wielding a shield or using an off-hand weapon (including armor spikes, unarmed strikes, or natural weapons).\n"
"<b>Dexterous Duelist</b>\n"
"At 7th level, an Aldori swordlord does not provoke attacks of opportunity when standing up from prone.\n"
"<b>Display Weapon Prowess</b>\n"
"At 2nd level, an Aldori swordlord adds a bonus equal to half his class level on Persuasion skill checks made to intimidate. He also gains an additional +1 bonus on Persuasion skill checks made to intimidate while using Dazzling Display with a dueling sword for each of the following feats he has with the dueling sword: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, or Weapon Specialization.\n"
"<b>Saving Slash</b>\n"
"At 6th level, when wielding a dueling sword, an Aldori swordlord can try deflecting a critical hit targeting him, reducing its damage to that of a normal hit, with a 25% chance of success. This does not stack with the fortification special ability of magical armor or similar effects.\n"
"<b>Greater Saving Slash</b>\n"
"At 9th level, an Aldori swordlord's saving slash has a 50% chance of reducing a critical hit to a normal hit.\n"
"<b>Shatter Confidence</b>\n"
"At 5th level, an Aldori swordlord attempts a Persuasion skill check to intimidate and demoralize his target as a free action after he confirms a critical hit or succeeds at a disarm, or sunder combat maneuver with a dueling sword. If his target is already shaken, the Aldori swordlord can once per round attempt a Persuasion check to Intimidate and demoralize the target further after any successful melee attack or combat maneuver. If he succeeds at this check, the target suffers an additional -1 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and loses all morale bonuses to these checks."

"Alignment represents a creature's basic moral and ethical attitude. Alignment has two components: one describing whether a creature is lawful, neutral, or chaotic, followed by another that describes whether a character is good, neutral, or evil.

In addition, few people are completely consistent.\n"

She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an arcane trickster, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.\n"

"An arcane trickster can use Trickery at a range of 30 feet. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5.\n"
"<b>Sneak Attack</b>\n"
"This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If an arcane trickster gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.\n"

"<b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>\n"
"Arcane tricksters gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Spells per Day</b>\n"
"When a new arcane trickster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an arcane trickster, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.\n"
"<b>Arcane Spellcasting</b>\n"
"At 1st level, Arcane Trickster selects an arcane spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. When a new arcane trickster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day and new spells known as if she had also gained a level in that spellcasting class.\n"
"<b>Ranged Legerdemain</b>\n"
"An arcane trickster can use Trickery at a range of 30 feet. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5.\n"
"<b>Sneak Attack</b>\n"
"This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If an arcane trickster gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.\n"
"<b>Impromptu Sneak Attack</b>\n"
"Beginning at 3rd level, an arcane trickster can enter a special stance that allows him to improvise a way to sneak attack targets regardless of their awareness. An arcane trickster can maintain this stance for one round per day. For every two levels above 3rd arcane trickster can maintain this stance for one additional round, up to a maximum of 4 rounds at 9th level. The target of impromptu sneak attacks loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, but only against those attacks.

All of Hell is his fortress, each layer serving as a nefarious rampart between Nessus, his sinister keep, and a multiverse that screams in want of order. He is the most dreaded enemy to the freedom and spirit of the multiverse's mortal inhabitants, yet the surest route to a grim but eternal peace.\n"
"Asmodeus can take any form he chooses, yet in the depictions of his faith and visions of his worshipers, he appears as a tall, muscular man with red skin, dark hair, short black horns, arrogant features, and hoofed feet. Whether this is the Archfiend's true form or merely a guise he adopts so his mortal servants can conceive of him, none can say. Some legends tell that he has another form — one that bears a great, endlessly bleeding wound he received during his final battle with his brother Ihys — but if any souls have ever witnessed this shape, they have never been allowed to leave Nessus. He is rarely seen without his symbol of rule, the Archstar, an artifact forged before the diabolic Exodus from Heaven that bears his symbol and often takes the form of a burning ruby mace, rod, or staff.\n"
"Asmodeus is beyond arrogant, beyond confident, and beyond patient. He knows that, eventually, the tide of the multiverse will turn, the young deities that hold such appeal to the souls of the mortal world will perish or move on, and moralities will shift, elevating him to a place of righteousness. So it was, and so it will be once more. He is known for his devastating bouts of wrath, yet his ire is but a tool to inspire fear, for few events in the last millennia have truly enraged him. None know the face of the Prince of Darkness's true fury — his disciplined facade being impenetrable — but those who cross him come to know suffering in their lives and beyond like nothing imaginable. As a being of impossible age and intelligence, he is a cold but reasonable emperor, and even what seem to be snap decisions have undergone deliberation and consideration from countless angles. Once he utters his commands, few can hope to change his mind to favor them. He demands order, and with his vast intellect, he can often perceive patterns and reasons where none seem present — tales say that he had a hand in arranging the placement of the stars, the architecture of living forms, and the laws of physical existence. All of his cunning, genius, and passion Asmodeus combines with a deft tongue and disarming charm. Even the most benevolent deities have, at times, sought out Asmodeus's counsel, and afterward, they have shuddered to realize that the Ruler of Hell is no monster but a charismatic, sane, and wise being, opposed to all they believe yet nonetheless deserving of their awe. Furthermore, he commands countless powerful minions, the greatest of which are his eight archdevil champions, who gather together once every 13 years to plot infernal politics and be informed of his will.\n"
"For all the powers and boons he grants the creatures of the Material Plane, Asmodeus loathes mortals. Certainly his worshipers prove useful in exacting his whims upon the planes, but he bears not even the greatest of them an iota of love. The creation of mortals has ruined the perfect order of the early multiverse; they sow chaos and disorder throughout the planes, and they nourish the most destructive forces of reality. They were the gods' first and greatest mistake, and these rampant souls will be a blight upon existence until they can be wiped out or fundamentally altered. Fortunately, Asmodeus is cultivating numerous subtle plans to bring about such ends. His stratagems have been in motion for centuries beyond counting — and they are working.\n"

"An athach is a twisted kind of giant, cruel and thuggish. It lives to bring misery, ruin, and terror to weaker creatures. An individual may be nearly any human color, though its arms are often a darker color or even grayish. Its upper fangs are long, extending from its mouth like those of a ferocious beast, and it constantly drools a weakness-inducing poison.\n"
"A group of athachs is usually a family unit, with gangs typically consisting of a group of siblings and full tribes consisting of parents and young.\n"
"Athachs thrive upon the fear of their victims, preferring to play with their prey for some time before indulging their vile and murderous natures. Tales tell of how athachs cut down orchards and ruin crops by night, leaving the ruins to be discovered by innocent villagers at the dawning of the following day. Further tales tell of how athachs desecrate graveyards by exhuming graves and scattering the bones of the dead about. The motivation behind these games seems to be sheer entertainment — some athachs are unusually creative in their antics, displaying ingenuity beyond their normal capacity, as if an athach in the throes of desecration and cruelty were prone to some form of divine inspiration.\n"

"Stewards of ancient, colossal cities on lawful planes, axiomites represent the fundamental search for order. According to their own history, the first axiomites sprang from the raw mathematical underpinnings of the cosmos long before the first gods began to stir — they are personifications of a primordial reality made flesh in an attempt to understand itself. New axiomites are formed from souls much like celestials or fiends, with spirits drawn across the planes to one of the axiomites' humming crystal monoliths, emerging later as purified creatures of law and theory.\n"
"A particular axiomite may look like any humanoid-shaped creature, though the particular form does not affect its abilities in any way. Beneath this form, all axiomites are the same — clouds of glowing, crystalline dust that constantly swirl and congeal into complex tangles of symbols and equations, making them literally creatures of pure mathematical law.\n"
"Axiomite society is broken into three divisions, each with its own duty and purpose. One devotes itself to the construction and maintenance of inevitables, another to the expansion and construction of their capital city, and the third to continuing the exploration and calculation of the laws and constants that underlie all of reality. Their leader is a gestalt mind formed by the greatest individuals of their race, forming when needed and then dispersing into its component axiomites to put the god-mind's plans into action."

In addition to their elf-like forms, they can take the shape of whirlwinds of dust, snow, or sand. In the mortal realm, they are often mistaken for djinn. They delight in violent weather, not for the destructive qualities of such events, but for the intensity and energy, and many tales describe bralani as spirits who laugh as they sail amid the strongest storms.\n"
"Bralanis do not need to eat, but they enjoy doing so. Most prefer elven food, fiery human dishes, and spiced wine. Because of their similarities to elementals and fey, they sometimes act as intermediaries between mortals, elementals, and fey, though they prefer to arrange temporary truces that allow the interested parties to conduct their own negotiations on neutral ground. When taking the role of mediators — or whenever else such opportunities present themselves — bralani are quick to suggest friendly competitions or games to end disputes and enjoy creating challenges or complicated contests to test both physical and mental mortal prowess."

"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Barbarian Proficiencies</b>\n"
"A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).\n"
"<b>Fast Movement</b>\n"
"A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.\n"
"<b>Uncanny Dodge</b>\n"
"The character can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her <link=\"Encyclopedia:Dexterity\"><b>Dexterity</b></link> bonus to AC if immobilized. A character with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.\n"
"If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.\n"
"<b>Danger Sense</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on <link=\"Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw\"><b>Reflex saves</b></link> to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).\n"
"<b>Improved Uncanny Dodge</b>\n"
"A character can no longer be flanked.\n"
"This defense denies another character the ability to sneak attack your character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more class levels than the target does.\n"
"<b>Damage Reduction</b>\n"
"At 7th level, a barbarian gains <link=\"Encyclopedia:Damage_Reduction\"><b>damage reduction</b></link>. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.\n"
"<b>Rage</b>\n"
"A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her <link=\"Encyclopedia:Constitution\"><b>Constitution</b></link> modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like bear's endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.\n"
"While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot cast spells or use any ability that requires patience or concentration.\n"
"A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.\n"
"<b>Rage Power</b>\n"
"As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.\n"
"<b>Greater Rage</b>\n"
"At 11th level, a barbarian's bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +3. In addition, the amount of temporary hit points gained when entering a rage increases to 3 per Hit Die.\n"
"<b>Tireless Rage</b>\n"
"Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.\n"
"<b>Mighty Rage</b>\n"
"At 20th level, a barbarian's bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +4. In addition, the amount of temporary hit points gained when entering a rage increases to 4 per Hit Die.\n"
"<b>Indomitable Will</b>\n"

"For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors — they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.\n"
"<b>Role</b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.\n"
"<b><link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\">Alignment</link>:</b> Any non-lawful\n"
"<b>Hit Die:</b> d12\n"
"<b>Skill Ranks Per Level:</b> 2 + Int modifier\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Barbarian Proficiencies</b>\n"
"A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).\n"
"<b>Fast Movement</b>\n"
"A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.\n"
"<b>Uncanny Dodge</b>\n"
"The character can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her <link=\"Encyclopedia:Dexterity\"><b>Dexterity</b></link> bonus to AC if immobilized. A character with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.\n"
"If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.\n"
"<b>Danger Sense</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on <link=\"Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw\"><b>Reflex saves</b></link> to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).\n"
"<b>Improved Uncanny Dodge</b>\n"
"A character can no longer be flanked.\n"
"This defense denies another character the ability to sneak attack your character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more class levels than the target does.\n"
"<b>Damage Reduction</b>\n"
"At 7th level, a barbarian gains <link=\"Encyclopedia:Damage_Reduction\"><b>damage reduction</b></link>. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.\n"
"<b>Rage</b>\n"
"A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her <link=\"Encyclopedia:Constitution\"><b>Constitution</b></link> modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like bear's endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.\n"
"While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot cast spells or use any ability that requires patience or concentration.\n"
"A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.\n"
"<b>Rage Power</b>\n"
"As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.\n"
"<b>Greater Rage</b>\n"
"At 11th level, a barbarian's bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +3. In addition, the amount of temporary hit points gained when entering a rage increases to 3 per Hit Die.\n"
"<b>Tireless Rage</b>\n"
"Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.\n"
"<b>Mighty Rage</b>\n"
"At 20th level, a barbarian's bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +4. In addition, the amount of temporary hit points gained when entering a rage increases to 4 per Hit Die.\n"
"<b>Indomitable Will</b>\n"
"While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage."

To be affected, an ally must be able to perceive the bard's performance. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls.

"Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature stands quietly and observes the performance for as long as the bard continues to maintain it. Any damage to the target automatically breaks the effect.\n"
"<b>Dirge of Doom</b>\n"
"A bard of 8th level or higher can use his performance to foster a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to take become shaken. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard's performance.

"<b>Inspire Greatness</b>\n"
"A bard of 9th level or higher can use his performance to inspire greatness in all allies within 30 feet, granting extra fighting capability. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves.\n"
"<b>Jack of All Trades</b>\n"
"Bard gains bonus +1 on all skill checks.\n"
"<b>Soothing Performance</b>\n"
"A bard of 12th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to the mass cure serious wounds, using the bard's level as the caster level.

"Untold wonders and secrets exist for those skillful enough to discover them. Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration. Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures of each.\n"
"<b>Role</b>: Bards capably confuse and confound their foes while inspiring their allies to ever-greater daring. While accomplished with both weapons and magic, the true strength of bards lies outside melee, where they can support their companions and undermine their foes without fear of interruptions to their performances.\n"

Those who hunt boars often do so with a special spear fitted with a cross beam to prevent an impaled boar from pushing forward along the spear shaft to gore its tormentor.\n"

"The creation of some unknown arcanist in millennia past, the bulette has bred true to become one of the fiercest predators of the hills. Burrowing rapidly through the earth just beneath the surface, sometimes with its armored fin cutting a distinctive wake behind it, the bulette launches itself free of stone and soil to tear into its prey without remorse, giving rise to the common appellation \"landshark.\"\n"
"Bulettes are notoriously foul-tempered, attacking far larger creatures with no regard for personal safety.\n"
"Solitary beasts except for the occasional mated pair, they spend most of their time patrolling the perimeters of territories that can stretch up to 30 square miles, hunting game and punishing interlopers with a fury that shakes the hillsides.\n"
"Bulettes are perfect eating machines, consuming bones, armor, and even magical items with their powerful jaws and churning stomach acid. Lacking other food, the bulette might gnaw on inanimate objects, yet for unknown reasons no bulette voluntarily consumes <link=\"Encyclopedia:Elves\"><b>elf</b></link> flesh — a peccadillo many point to as evidence that elven wizardry was involved in its creation. Dwarves are also rarely eaten by the beasts, though the bulette still slaughters members of either race on sight. Halflings, on the other hand, are among the beast's favorite meals, and no halfling with any sense ventures into bulette country casually.\n"
"The bulette is a cunning fighter, surprising foes with its impressive agility. One of its favorite tactics is to charge forward and launch itself into the air in order to drop on its prey with all four razor-sharp claws extended.\n"
"Folklore claims that the flesh behind the beast's dorsal crest is particularly tender, and that those willing and able to wait until the fin is raised in the excitement of combat or mating can target it for a killing blow — yet most who have faced the landshark agree that the best way to win a fight with a bulette is to avoid it entirely."

"Calistria is the most widely worshiped elven goddess on Golarion — an ancient deity with a long memory for old slights, at once mysterious, alluring, temperamental, and passionate. Although most of her worshipers are elves, she is popular with other races as well, for at some point almost everyone has felt the fire of lust, engaged in trickery, or been driven to revenge. She is not so much a spiritual guide for the elven people as a cornerstone for their culture, never pushing them to act but always ready to assist when the time comes for action.\n"
"The Savored Sting is a sultry manifestation of everything in elves that is fascinating to other races, attracting men and women alike with her raw sexual magnetism. Her beauty is typically characterized as sensual, desirable, and arousing, or described in more vulgar terms. Gazing on Calistria's clothed body, viewers wonder what she looks like naked; her nude form drives their curiosity to even more intimate places. Although she considers herself female, Calistria has been known to take on a male form that is attractive enough to make any mortal flushed and weak in the knees.\n"
"She is mischievous, perplexing, devious, and silver-tongued, disarming her most powerful rivals with pretty words that, upon careful reflection, reveal themselves as humiliating insults. She \"surrenders\" by convincing enemies to hand over their weapons, leads suitors on for decades with hints of outrageous rewards, and outwits the most brilliant mortals as an afterthought. Though her sense of humor is rich and sharp, she considers silly jokes and crude pranks beneath one who can convey an hour's speech in one small gesture and a lifetime of emotion with a careful look. Lies are her meat and drink, half-truths are her favorite wine, and double entendres are a luscious dessert.\n"
"Calistria enjoys a quick resolution to petty affronts, but she is patient, unforgiving, and merciless when more seriously offended, willing to punish the offender with exacting artistry beyond the ken of mortals. Calistria does not forgive, she does not forget, and any evidence to the contrary is part of her plan to sting a foe in the most painful way possible after he believes the threat of vengeance is long past. She is a goddess of vengeance, not justice, and feels no compulsion to stop at taking an eye for an eye; if she pushes beyond a response others might deem appropriate, it should serve as a lesson to those who get in her way.\n"
"Though gracious and personable to those who haven't drawn her ire, Calistria is fickle, changing loyalties as suits her needs and whims. Her changeability is not malicious; rather, she is uninterested in relationships becoming too strong or too emotional, believing such bonds to be foolish. Most of her partners and allies accept the affection she grants them and then move on, but those who persist in the chase after she has tired of being the prey find her claws sharp and certain. She sees love only as a weakness, a needless by-product of physical pleasures.\n"
"Calistria welcomes the worship of any mortal who lusts, deceives, or seeks revenge; she hears the prayers of the good, evil, unjustly accused, selfish, moral, criminal, and love-struck alike. Regardless of methods or motives, if a mortal's actions touch her concerns, she takes an interest in the outcome and may aid in achieving it. Her worshipers are thus diverse, but mostly transitional, only seeking her attention when they need her. As she in turn only engages with others when her interest is piqued, this satisfies her, and she does not ask for more.\n"
"Some mortals, unable to emulate or understand her shifting interests and allegiances, accuse Calistria of being evil, but in truth, she is simply amoral, eschewing right, wrong, and justice because she knows that the universe is not a fair place. If others choose to follow her path, so be it; if some are hurt by such a decision, she stands as a reminder that every creature has the right — and the responsibility — to avenge their injuries.\n"
"Calistria is usually depicted as a beautiful elven woman wearing a figure-hugging black dress accented with gold, often with a black or golden silk drape falling from her arms or drawn seductively across her face. Her eyes are dark and mysterious, but sometimes flash gold with passion or anger. She is commonly shown with giant wasps, her favorite creature — for unlike bees, wasps can sting again and again without dying. In her male form she usually wears a masculine version of her normal shape, with black leggings and a loose golden jerkin and cape, eyes smoldering with barely contained passion. Depending on the views of the surrounding society, Calistria's worshipers are also not afraid of depicting her in more scandalous attire or situations, and sexually explicit art featuring the goddess is common.\n"
"Calistria's holy symbol is three daggers pointing outward from a circle (representing her three aspects); many of her clergy carry daggers in her honor. Most of her priests are clerics or bards, though in some places more exotic spellcasters are the norm for her clergy, and even some non-spellcasters reach positions of moderate importance in her priesthood based on their cunning and achievements. Her titles include the Savored Sting, the Lady in the Room, and the Unquenchable Fire, as well as many vulgar epithets bestowed by those outside the faith.\n"

msgid ""
"Cayden Cailean is one of the Ascended, a mortal man who became a god after passing the grueling tests of the magical Starstone. Three days after entering the Cathedral of the Starstone on a drunken dare, the good-natured sellsword emerged a living god, baffled and amused. His behavior changed little after his ascension: he continued to fight for just causes, sample various drinks, and avoid things he didn't want to do. Thus, Cayden Cailean became the patron of brave souls, alcoholic spirits, and the freedom to choose your own path in life. He expects his followers to be brave in the face of danger, though there is no shame in necessary retreat — he's the god of bravery, not reckless stupidity. Although many assume his faithful will accept any dare, the god's focus on freedom keeps his heroes from being manipulated so easily, and even the dullest hero of Cayden Cailean has the sense not to accept an impossible or suicidal challenge — though it is not uncommon to accept a risky one after a swig or two of \"liquid courage.\"\n"
"Cayden Cailean is outgoing, friendly, boisterous, unashamed, and flirtatious, even more so when he indulges in fermented delights. He loves good-spirited toasts, friendly bar brawls, bawdy songs, and standing up for the underdog. He loathes slavery, mean-spiritedness, bullying, teetotalers, and restrictive laws and customs. He believes that everyone would get along better if they could all just sit down and have a drink, preferably in the company of attractive companions. A former mercenary, he believes in fair pay for a job well done, whether in coin, drink, or a tumble in the hay with an enthusiastic paramour.\n"
"Cayden Cailean's direct intervention in the mortal world isn't frequent, but he has been known to prevent a keg from emptying (often to help good folk survive a siege or convince them to congregate a little longer in a place of safety) or to push someone especially meek to show courage at a key moment. Having had his share of hard times as a mortal, he's not above helping someone for free now and then, or leaving an extra-generous tip for someone in need. This simple and welcoming philosophy makes him popular with adventurers, philanthropists, revelers, and those who fight for good, and it is traditional among his adherents to toast his name with the first drink of the evening.\n"
"As the god of wine, Cayden's interest is in the merriment and socialization alcohol can facilitate rather than attempting to drown or forget sorrows, and he despises mean drunks or those who allow their drunkenness to hurt innocents. He has been known to inspire tipsy revelers to confess secrets better aired than left to fester, and he encourages his worshipers to push each other to greatness via friendly dares. A \"Cayden's dare\" is any foolish-seeming thing that turns out to have beneficial consequences, and at Caydenite weddings, it's common to tell jokes and stories explaining how the bride or groom is only present because of a drunken dare (especially if they're true).\n"
"Although his other divine concerns are flexible in interpretation, Cayden is as hard as nails when it comes to a person's right to freedom. Coupled with his love of drink, his refusal in his mortal days to go against his own beliefs for the sake of mere coin gave him a somewhat unreliable reputation. He believes there is no justice in a law that oppresses one person to benefit another, and over the centuries he has worked to counter slavery and the plots of deities who see human misery as a fair price to pay in pursuit of their goals. In places where the peasantry suffers from harsh taxes or demoralizing practices, he helps them topple their oppressors or at least aids them in escaping to more friendly lands. Though often seen as a god of righteous rebellion, he doesn't believe in vengeance or coups for their own sake, and is not a god of destructive chaos or madcap frivolity — his followers must take responsibility for the consequences of their actions.\n"
"Those who go against Cayden's simple tenets may find themselves ill the next time they drink, intoxicated when clarity is needed, or frightened by common animals or shadows. When he is happy, drinks are more delicious, the night air feels brisker and smells sweeter, and courage burns white-hot. An unexpected windfall of alcohol is a common sign of favor, yet can just as easily turn to vinegar or sewage in the mouths of the unworthy.\n"
"When Cayden Cailean appears to his followers, he usually looks much as he did in life: an average-looking bronze-skinned human with a tankard in one hand, often wearing chainmail. In grander art, he is sometimes shown fending off a swarm of devils with his well-worn rapier, all while holding his tankard high. Some artists portray the Drunken Hero with broken shackles hanging loosely from his wrists or fallen at his feet, representing breaking free of mortal concerns — though in areas where his faith has brought freedom from oppression or slavery, the shackles have a more literal interpretation.\n"
"Cayden Cailean is the only major god who uses a surname. In his early years as a god, he insisted that his last name be included in all forms of address, an unusual habit for someone normally so relaxed about formalities. The prevalent opinions on the matter are that he wished to distance himself from another mortal named Cayden (perhaps someone of evil intent) or to honor his parents, said to have died when he was young. This second theory is corroborated by his interest in sponsoring orphanages, perhaps as a thank-you to the long-gone orphanage that raised him. He ignores questions about the matter, insisting that it was decided long ago and there are more important things to talk about.\n"
"Cayden's holy symbol is a tankard of ale, with or without a rich head of foam on it. He is called the Drunken Hero, the Lucky Drunk, and many other affectionate nicknames. He's amused rather than offended by those who use his name as part of colorful oaths, and thus many of his clergy can be creative and prolific in their swearing. Most of his true \"clergy\" are clerics, but he is also honored by hordes of good-natured rogues, barbarians, and fighters who — despite not receiving any direct boons from the god — seek to spread his faith and emulate his relaxed attitude toward a mercenary or adventuring life. His priesthood also includes some inquisitors, mainly those questing to free slaves and overturn tyrants, as well as a handful of druids who attend to sacred vineyards and the other agricultural aspects of brewing.\n"

Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these emissaries of the divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms and the magic of their gods. Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing and redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and corruption. The ways of the cleric are varied, yet all who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the arms of the gods themselves.\n"
"<b>Role:</b> More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true strength lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase their own and their allies' prowess in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need. As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion—such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge—free of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if you prefer this path to selecting a specific deity.)\n"
"<b><link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\">Alignment</link>:</b> A cleric's alignment must be within one step of her deity's, along with either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis\n"
"<b>Hit Die:</b> d8\n"
"<b>Skill Ranks Per Level:</b> 1 + Int modifier\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Cleric Proficiencies</b>\n"
"Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Clerics are also proficient with the favored weapon of their deities.\n"
"<b>Aura</b>\n"
"A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment\n"
"<b>Deity Selection</b>\n"
"A deity, also known as a god or goddess, is a being or force of incredible power capable of granting its power to mortal beings through divine magic. A deity is strongly associated with a specific alignment, several domains, and a plane (typically an Outer Sphere plane).\n"
"<b>Channel Energy</b>\n"
"Regardless of alignment, any cleric can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.\n"
"A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see spontaneous casting).\n"
"Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric's level + the cleric's Charisma modifier. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A cleric can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.\n"
"This choice also determines whether the cleric converts his spells to cure spells or to inflict spells.\n"
"<b>Domain Selection</b>\n"
"A cleric's or inquisitor's deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her alignment matches that domain.\n"
"Each domain grants a number of domain powers, dependent upon the level of the cleric or the inquisitor.\n"
"Clerics as well gain a number of bonus spells. A cleric gains one domain spell slot for each level of cleric spell she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a cleric can prepare one of the spells from her two domains in that slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in her domain spell slot. Domain spells cannot be used to cast spells spontaneously.\n"
"<b>Greater Domain Power</b>\n"
"At 8th level, you can use domain's greater power.\n"
"<b>Orisons</b>\n"
"Clerics can cast a number of Orisons, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.\n"
"<b>Spontaneous casting</b>\n"
"A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can \"lose\" any prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with \"cure\" in its name).\n"
"An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity) can't convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with \"inflict\" in its name).\n"
"A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player's choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric channels positive or negative energy (see channel energy)."

"Desna is an impulsive and aloof goddess who delights in freedom, discovery, and mystery. Her aloofness stems not from arrogance, but from confidence in her own abilities and her desire to be unburdened by troubles. She is a collection of contrasts — an ancient goddess who dislikes predicting the future, a traveler who cares nothing for her destination, a carefree creature of instinct haunted by a past stretching back eons, and a peaceful deity forced to battle with old enemies, eternally young despite the weight of ages and stars upon her.\n"
"Some believe Desna is flighty, frivolous, and easily distracted, but she has a cold side born of loss, tragedy, and battle. As a luck goddess, she always believes there is a chance for success, but knows that dreams can turn to nightmares and bright destinies can become dark fates; these opposites in her own nature define her and give her things to strive against. She challenges those who would corrupt her domain or who have wronged her friends or followers, striking at them with burning starlight, bad luck, and energies alien to Golarion.\n"
"Although her dominion over dreams and stars means that many seers, diviners, and mystics revere her as an informal goddess of prophecy, she delights in the freedom of people to choose their own destiny and only uses her power to help others make good choices, avoid troublesome outcomes, and achieve happiness. She believes that \"doom and gloom\" prophecies or those that seem to guarantee or self-fulfll horrible acts are distasteful, and she only hands out such messages in the direst circumstances. She prefers to use prophecy as a tool for exploration and creating choices, not\n"
"for limiting action and snuffing hope.\n"
"When Desna has a message for one of her faithful, she prefers to intervene in dreams, sending simple impressions, visions, or even prophecies that the sleeper clearly remembers upon awakening. When dreams are unsuitable or time is short, she indicates her favor with flights of swallowtail butterflies, sparrows, dragonflies, geese flying in a four-pointed star shape, or the timely arrival of messenger birds. She typically shows her disfavor with dreamless sleep that fails to refresh the sleeper (as if the person had not slept at all), sore feet, messenger animals losing their messages, and minor travel accidents.\n"
"Desna watches over those who travel for any reason. Trailblazers, scouts, adventurers, and sailors all praise her name. (Although most sailors honor Gozreh in some fashion, he is a temperamental deity, and a little luck from Desna often comes in handy during a storm.) Her influence over luck also makes her a favorite among gamblers, thieves, and others who rely on fortune for shady dealings.\n"
"Desna teaches her followers to indulge their desires, experience all they can, and trust instinct as a guide. Her faithful are often wide-eyed, exuberant people, embracing the world in all its strangeness, and willing to jump in with both feet. Desnans aren't afraid to get their hands dirty, their feet wet, or their knuckles (or faces) bloodied while living life to its fullest. Critics call them hedonists, but that's an exaggeration, as worldly experience, rather than pure sensation, is their true goal. Ascetics, hermits, and meticulous planners are unknown in her church. Her faithful teach that it's better to ask forgiveness than permission, as sometimes a unique opportunity requires a split-second decision, whether it's a chance to touch a dragon's egg, savor a rare fruit, or passionately kiss the mayor's son.\n"
"The goddess encourages her worshipers to believe in themselves and express their inner strengths, often in the form of music, dance, or theater. Many songs penned by her faithful become popular tunes for dancing and gatherings, and numerous old favorites are attributed to long-dead Desnan bards whose musical legacies have persisted for centuries. Some people believe the custom of a traveling bard paying for his lodging with a song stems from Desna's church, and like bards, followers of Desna encourage young folk to sing and dance in the hope of discovering hidden talents.\n"
"Desna usually appears to her followers as a beautiful but remote elven acolyte of her faith. In this guise, she aids people in need or suggests relevant excerpts from her holy writings, The Eight Scrolls, as a way to lead the faithful on the correct path. She is not above singing to lighten dour moods or dancing with those whose confidence is in need of reinvigoration. When Desna wishes to reveal her true nature, she transforms her common clothing into a billowing silken gown and grows brightly colored butterfly wings on her back, although in somber situations her wing colors are pale and moth-like.\n"
"Desna's holy symbol is a butterfly with images of stars, suns, and moons upon its wings. Most of her clergy are clerics, although about one-third of her priests are bards or rogues, with a number of neutral good druids and rangers also choosing her as their patron. She is called the Song of the Spheres, the Great Dreamer, Starsong, and the Tender of Dreams.\n"

"Related to pseudodragons, faerie dragons are whimsical, playful pranksters that spend most of their time either relaxing in cool forest glades or engaged in some sort of prank. Although such mischief is usually spontaneous, some faerie dragons have been known to spend months or even years in preparation of one truly spectacular joke.\n"
"Travelers making their way through lands known to be inhabited by these good-natured — but sometimes annoying — tricksters are advised to keep up their guard lest they face all manner of creative annoyances (horses painted with berry juice, squirrels placed inside bedrolls, and clothing decorating high branches being a few examples).\n"
"Unlike true dragons, faerie dragons do not grow larger with age, but their scales do change color, starting with red and moving through the rainbow to reach dark violet at old age. Faerie dragons grow in power as spellcasters as they age (typically gaining levels in sorcerer), learning more powerful spells to complement their innate abilities. The spells of faerie dragons tend to focus on tools that can be used to create or enhance pranks, and illusion and enchantment spells are particularly popular.\n"
"Faerie dragons avoid combat unless there is no other option. If forced to fight, faerie dragons attempt to confound enemies rather than kill them, using both spells and breath weapon to weaken and scatter foes before fleeing. The only exception to this is when a faerie dragon's clan or allies are in danger.

"As some of the most ancient, powerful, and capricious creatures in existence, dragons occasionally enter into trysts with unsuspecting mortals or sire offspring with exceptional individuals. Likewise, the great power wielded by these creatures has long intrigued wizards and alchemists who have sought various magical methods to infuse their bodies with draconic power. As a result, the blood of dragons runs through the veins of many races. For some, this heritage manifests as a sorcerous bloodline and a predilection for magic; for others, however, the power of their draconic ancestors becomes an obsession.\n"
"Spellcasters who embrace their draconic heritage and learn to channel their abilities can become dragon disciples, fearsome warriors who possess not only the repertoire of an accomplished sorcerer but also the ability to unleash the furious power of dragons upon their foes. As dragon disciples discover the power of their forebears, they can learn to breathe fire, take flight on leathery wings, and — at the pinnacle of their abilities — assume the form of a dragon. Although they are rare, dragon disciples can be found in any land where dragons interact with mortals.\n"
"<b>Class Details</b>\n"
"<b><link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\">Alignment</link>:</b> Dragon disciples can be of any alignment, although they tend to be more chaotic than lawful. Those dragon disciples that assume the traits of chromatic dragons, such as bestial white and fearsome red dragons, have a proclivity for evil. Conversely, those that take after the metallic dragons, such as stoic brass and chivalric gold dragons, are often of good alignments.\n"
"<b>Hit Die:</b> d12.\n"
"<b>Requirements</b>\n"
"To qualify to become a dragon disciple, a character must fulfill all the following criteria:\n"
"<b>Race:</b> Any non-dragon.\n"
"<b>Skills:</b> Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks.\n"
"<b>Spellcasting:</b> Ability to cast 1st level arcane spells without preparation. If the character has sorcerer levels, he must have the draconic bloodline. If the character gains levels of sorcerer after taking this class, he must take the draconic bloodline.\n"
"<b>Class Skills</b>\n"
"The dragon disciple's class skills are Mobility, Knowledge (Arcana), Knowledge (World), Lore (Nature), Lore (Religion), Persuasion and Perception.\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Blood of Dragons</b>\n"
"A dragon disciple adds his level to his sorcerer levels when determining the powers gained from his bloodline. If the dragon disciple does not have levels of sorcerer, he instead gains bloodline powers of the draconic bloodline, using his dragon disciple level as his sorcerer level to determine the bonuses gained. He must choose a dragon type upon gaining his first level in this class and that type must be the same as his sorcerer type. This ability does not grant bonus spells to a sorcerer unless he possesses spell slots of an appropriate level. Such bonus spells are automatically granted if the sorcerer gains spell slots of the spell's level.\n"
"<b>Natural Armor Increase (+1)</b>\n"
"As his skin thickens, a dragon disciple takes on more and more of his progenitor's physical aspect. At 1st, 4th, and 7th level, a dragon disciple gains a +1 increase to the character's existing natural armor (if any). These armor bonuses stack.\n"
"<b>Ability Boost — Strength (+2)</b>\n"
"As a dragon disciple gains levels in this prestige class, a dragon disciple takes on more and more of his progenitor's physical aspect. At 2nd and 4th levels, a dragon disciple gains a +2 increase to the character's Strength score. These bonuses stack.\n"
"<b>Dragon Bite</b>\n"
"At 2nd level dragon disciple gains a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the dragon disciple is Small), plus 1–1/2 times the dragon disciple's Strength modifier. Upon reaching 6th level, this bite also deals 1d6 points of energy damage. The type of damage dealt is determined by the dragon disciple's bloodline.\n"
"<b>Spells per Day</b>\n"
"At 2nd level, and at every level thereafter, with an exception for 5th and 9th levels, a Dragon Disciple gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known, and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an Dragon Disciple, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.\n"
"<b>Blindsense</b>\n"
"At 5th level, the dragon disciple gains blindsense with a range of 25 feet. Using non-visual senses the dragon disciple notices things he cannot see. He usually does not need to make Perception checks to notice and pinpoint the location of creatures within range of his blindsense ability, provided that he has line of effect to that creature.\n"
"Any opponent the dragon disciple cannot see still has total concealment against him, and the dragon disciple still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see. At 10th level, the range of this ability increases to 50 feet.\n"
"<b>Breath Weapon</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, a dragon disciple gains the breath weapon bloodline power, even if his level does not yet grant that power. Once his level is high enough to grant this ability through the bloodline, the dragon disciple gains an additional use of his breath weapon each day. The type and shape of the breath weapon depends on the type of dragon selected by the dragon disciple.\n"
"<b>Ability Boost — Constitution (+2)</b>\n"
"Upon reaching 6th level, a dragon disciple gains a +2 increase to the character's Constitution score.\n"
"<b>Dragon Form</b>\n"
"At 7th level, a dragon disciple can assume the form of a dragon. This ability works like dragonkind I spell. At 10th level, this ability functions as dragonkind II spell, and the dragon disciple can use this ability twice per day. His caster level for this effect is equal to his effective sorcerer levels for his draconic bloodline.\n"
"<b>Ability Boost — Intelligence (+2)</b>\n"
"Upon reaching 8th level, a dragon disciple gains a +2 increase to the character's Intelligence score."

"Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.\n"
"<b>Role</b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.\n"

"A druid gains a +2 bonus on Lore (nature) checks.\n"
"<b>Nature Bond</b>\n"
"At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.\n"
"The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion.\n"
"<b>Animal Companions</b>\n"
"An animal companion's abilities are determined by the druid's level and its animal racial traits.\n"
"<b>Orisons</b>\n"
"Druids can cast a number of Orisons, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.\n"
"<b>Alignment Restriction</b>\n"
"A druid who changes to a prohibited alignment loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she changes the alignment back.\n"
"<b>Spontaneous Summoning</b>\n"
"A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can \"lose\" a prepared spell in order to cast any summon nature's ally spell of the same level or lower.\n"
"<b>Resist Nature's Lure</b>\n"
"Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey and plants.\n"
"<b>Venom Immunity</b>\n"
"At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons."

"Duelists represent the pinnacle of elegant swordplay. They move with a grace unmatched by most foes, parrying blows and countering attacks with swift thrusts of their blades. They may wear armor, but generally eschew such bulky protection as their grace allows them to dodge their opponents with ease. While others flounder on treacherous terrain, duelists charge nimbly across the battlefield, leaping and tumbling into the fray. They thrive in melee, where their skill with the blade allows them to make sudden attacks against clumsy foes and to cripple opponents with particularly well-placed thrusts of the blade.\n"
"The path to the duelist is natural for rogues and bards, as those classes do not rely on armor for defense, although nearly as many duelists come from the ranks of fighters and rangers. They are often found in those regions that possess elaborate rules and etiquette for battle.\n"
"<b>Class Details</b>\n"
"<b><link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\">Alignment</link>:</b> Duelists can be of any alignment, although since most hail from backgrounds as rogues or bards, they tend to eschew lawful behavior.

"<b>Hit Die:</b> d10.\n"

"<b>Class Skills</b>\n"
"The duelist's class skills are Mobility, Perception and Persuasion.\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Canny Defense</b>\n"
"When wearing light or no armor and not using a shield, a duelist adds 1 point of Intelligence bonus (if any) per duelist class level as a dodge bonus to her Armor Class while wielding a melee weapon. If a duelist is caught flat-footed or otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also loses this bonus.\n"
"<b>Precise Strike</b>\n"
"A duelist gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, adding her duelist level to her damage roll.\n"
"To make a precise strike, a duelist cannot have a weapon in her other hand or use a shield. A duelist's precise strike only works against creatures with discernible anatomies. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is also immune to a precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from a precise strike.\n"
"<b>Improved Reaction</b>\n"
"At 2nd level, a duelist gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. At 8th level, the bonus increases to +4. This bonus stacks with the benefit provided by the Improved Initiative feat.\n"
"<b>Parry</b>\n"
"At 2nd level, a duelist learns to parry melee attacks of other creatures, causing them to miss. Whenever the duelist makes a full attack with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, she can elect to make one attack less. Before her next turn, she can attempt to parry the first attack against her or the first attack against adjacent ally as an immediate action. To parry the attack, the duelist makes an attack roll, using the same bonuses as the attack she chose to forego during her previous action. If her attack roll is greater than the roll of the attacking creature, the attack automatically misses. For each size category that the attacking creature is larger than the duelist, the duelist takes a –4 penalty on her attack roll. The duelist also takes a –4 penalty when attempting to parry an attack made against an adjacent ally.\n"
"<b>Enhanced Mobility</b>\n"
"Starting at 3rd level, when wearing light or no armor and not using a shield, a duelist gains an additional +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity caused when she moves out of a threatened square.\n"
"<b>Grace</b>\n"
"At 4th level, a duelist gains an additional +2 competence bonus on all Reflex saving throws.\n"
"<b>Riposte</b>\n"
"Starting at 5th level, a duelist can make an attack of opportunity against any creature whose attack she successfully parries, so long as the creature she is attacking is within reach.\n"
"<b>Acrobatic Movement</b>\n"
"At 6th level, a duelist movement speed is no longer reduced on difficult terrain. Depending on the circumstance, she may still need to make appropriate checks to successfully move over the terrain.\n"
"<b>Elaborate Defense</b>\n"
"At 7th level and higher, if a duelist chooses to fight defensively in melee combat, she gains an additional +1 dodge bonus to AC for every 3 levels of duelist she has attained.\n"
"<b>Deflect Arrows</b>\n"
"At 9th level, a duelist gains the benefit of the Deflect Arrows feat when using a light or one-handed piercing weapon. The duelist does not need a free hand to use this feat.\n"
"<b>No Retreat</b>\n"
"At 9th level, enemies adjacent to the duelist that take a withdraw action provoke an attack of opportunity from the duelist.\n"
"<b>Crippling Critical</b>\n"
"When you confirm a critical hit using a light or one-handed piercing weapon, you can apply one of the following penalties in addition to the damage dealt: reduce the target's movement speed by a half, 1d4 points of Strength or Dexterity damage, –4 penalty on all saving throws, –4 penalty to Armor Class, or 2d6 points of bleed damage. These penalties last for 1 minute, except for ability damage, which must be healed normally, and bleed damage, which continues until the target receives magic healing or leaves combat."

"<b>Physical Description:</b>\n"
"Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot shorter than most humans, with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearance. Male and female dwarves pride themselves on the long length of their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and intricate braids. Clean-shavenness on a male dwarf is a sure sign of madness, or worse — no one familiar with their race trusts a beardless dwarven man.\n"
"<b>Society:</b>\n"
"The great distances between dwarves' mountain citadels account for many of the cultural differences that exist within their society. Despite these schisms, dwarves throughout the world are characterized by their love of stonework, their passion for stone- and metal-based craftsmanship and architecture, and their fierce hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids. In some remote enclaves, such as those areas where these races are uncommon or unheard of, dwarves' fixation on security and safety combined with their rather pugnacious nature leads them to find enemies or at least rivals wherever they settle. While they are not precisely militaristic, they learned long ago that those without axes can be hewn apart by them, and thus dwarves everywhere are schooled to be ready to enforce their rights and claims by force of arms. When their patience with diplomacy is exhausted, dwarves do not hesitate to adopt what they call \"aggressive negotiations.\"\n"
"<b>Relations:</b>\n"
"Dwarves and orcs have long dwelt in proximity to one another and share a history of violence as old as both races. Dwarves generally distrust and shun <link=\"Encyclopedia:Half-orcs\"><b>half-orcs</b></link>. They find <link=\"Encyclopedia:Elves\"><b>elves</b></link>, <link=\"Encyclopedia:Gnomes\"><b>gnomes</b></link>, and <link=\"Encyclopedia:Halflings\"><b>halflings</b></link> to be too frail, flighty, or \"pretty\" to be worthy of proper respect. It is with <link=\"Encyclopedia:Humans\"><b>humans</b></link> that dwarves share the strongest link, for humans' industrious nature and hearty appetites come closest to matching those of the dwarven ideal.\n"
"<b>Alignment and Religion:</b>\n"
"Dwarves are driven by honor and tradition. While they are often stereotyped as standoffish, they have a strong sense of friendship and justice, and those who win their trust understand that while they work hard, they play even harder — especially when good ale is involved. Most dwarves are <link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\"><b>lawful good</b></link>.\n"
"<b>Adventurers:</b>\n"
"Although dwarven adventurers are rare compared to humans, they can be found in most regions of the world. Dwarves often leave the confines of their redoubts to seek glory for their clans, to find wealth with which to enrich the fortress-homes of their birth, or to reclaim fallen dwarven citadels from racial enemies. Dwarven warfare is often characterized by tunnel fighting and melee combat, and as such most dwarves tend toward classes such as fighters and barbarians.\n"

"Fearsome warriors and spellcasters, eldritch knights are rare among magic-users in their ability to wade into battle alongside fighters, barbarians, and other martial classes. Those who must face eldritch knights in combat fear them greatly, for their versatility on the battlefield is tremendous; against heavily armed and armored opponents they may level crippling spells, while opposing spellcasters meet their ends on an eldritch knight's blade.\n"
"Because the road to becoming an eldritch knight requires both martial prowess and arcane power, eldritch knights almost always begin their paths as multiclassed characters, such as fighter/wizards or ranger/sorcerers. They may be found wherever studies of the arcane are as prevalent as martial training.\n"
"<b>Class Details</b>\n"
"<b><link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\">Alignment</link>:</b> The road to becoming an eldritch knight is as varied as the paths leading to apprenticeship under a wizard or a career as a soldier, and eldritch knights can therefore be of any alignment.

"<b>Weapon Proficiency:</b> Must be proficient with all martial weapons.\n"
"<b>Class Skills</b>\n"
"The eldritch knight's class skills are Athletics, Knowledge (Arcana), Knowledge (World) and Perception.\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Bonus Combat Feat</b>\n"
"At 1st level, an eldritch knight may choose a bonus combat feat. This is in addition to the feats that a character of any class normally gets from advancing levels. The character must still meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats. An eldritch knight gains an additional combat feat at 5th and 9th level.\n"
"<b>Diverse Training</b>\n"
"An eldritch knight adds his level to any levels of fighter he might have for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites for feats (if he has no fighter levels, treat his eldritch knight levels as levels of fighter). He also adds his level to any levels in an arcane spellcasting class for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites for feats.\n"
"<b>Spell Critical</b>\n"

"<b>Physical Description:</b>\n"
"Generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, slender physique that is accentuated by their long, pointed ears. It is a mistake, however, to consider them weak or feeble, as the thin limbs of an elf can contain surprising power. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with large, vibrantly colored pupils. The coloration of elves as a whole varies wildly and is much more diverse than that of human populations. However, as their coloration often matches their surroundings, the elves of a single community may appear quite similar. Forest-dwelling elves often have variations of green, brown, and tan in their hair, eye, and even skin tones.\n"
"While elven clothing often plays off the beauty of the natural world, those elves who live in cities tend to bedeck themselves in the latest fashions. Where city-dwelling elves encounter other urbanites, the elves are often fashion trendsetters.\n"
"<b>Society:</b>\n"
"Many elves feel a bond with nature and strive to live in harmony with the natural world. Although, like most, elves prefer bountiful lands where resources are plentiful, when driven to live in harsher climates, they work hard to protect and shepherd the region's bounty and learn how to maximize the benefit they receive from what little can be harvested. When they can carve out a sustainable, reliable life in deserts and wastelands, they take pride as a society in the accomplishment. While this can make them excellent guides to outsiders they befriend who must travel through such lands, their disdain of those who have not learned to live off the scant land as they have makes such friends rare.\n"
"Elves have an innate gift for craftsmanship and artistry, especially when working in wood, bone, ivory, or leather. Most, however, find manipulating earth and stone to be distasteful and prefer to avoid forging, stonework, and pottery. When such work must be done within a community, a few elves may find themselves drawn to it, but regardless of their craftsmanship, such \"dirt-wrights\" are generally seen by other elves as being a bit off. In the most insular of elven societies, they may even be treated as lower class.\n"
"Elves also have an appreciation for the written word, magic, and painstaking research. Their naturally keen minds and senses, combined with their inborn patience, make them particularly suited to wizardry. Arcane research and accomplishment are seen as both practical goals, in line with being a soldier or architect, and artistic endeavors as great as poetry or sculpture. Within elven society, wizards are held in extremely high regard as masters of an art both powerful and aesthetically valued. Other spellcasters are not disdained, but do not gain the praise lavished upon elven wizards.\n"
"<b>Relations:</b>\n"
"Elves are prone to dismissing other races, writing them off as rash and impulsive, yet on an individual level, they are excellent judges of character. In many cases an elf will come to value a specific member of another race, seeing that individual as deserving and respectable, while still dismissing the race as a whole. If called on this behavior, the elf often doesn't understand why his \"special friend\" is upset the elf has noticed the friend is \"so much better than the rest of his kind.\" Even elves who see such prejudice for what it is must constantly watch themselves to prevent such views from coloring their thinking.\n"
"Elves are not foolish enough, however, to dismiss all aspects of other races and cultures. An elf might not want a dwarf neighbor, but would be the first to acknowledge <link=\"Encyclopedia:Dwarves\"><b>dwarves'</b></link> skill at smithing and their tenacity in facing orc threats. Elves regard <link=\"Encyclopedia:Gnomes\"><b>gnomes</b></link> as strange (and sometimes dangerous) curiosities but regard their magical talent as being worthy of praise and respect. <link=\"Encyclopedia:Halflings\"><b>halflings</b></link> are often viewed with a measure of pity, for these small folk seem to the elves to be adrift, without a traditional home. Elves are fascinated with <link=\"Encyclopedia:Humans\"><b>humans</b></link>, who seem to live in a few short years as full a life as an elf manages in centuries. In fact, many elves become infatuated with humans, as evidenced by the number of <link=\"Encyclopedia:Half-elves\"><b>half-elves</b></link> in the world. Elves have difficulty accepting crossbreeds of any sort, however, and usually disown such offspring. They similarly regard <link=\"Encyclopedia:Half-orcs\"><b>half-orcs</b></link> with distrust and suspicion, assuming they possess the worst aspects of orc and human personalities.\n"
"<b>Alignment and Religion:</b>\n"
"Elves are emotional and capricious, yet value kindness and beauty. Most elves are <link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\"><b>chaotic good</b></link>, wishing all creatures to be safe and happy, but unwilling to sacrifice personal freedom or choice to accomplish such goals. They prefer deities who share their love of the mystic qualities of the world.\n"
"<b>Adventurers:</b>\n"
"Many elves embark on adventures out of a desire to explore the world, leaving their secluded realms to reclaim forgotten elven magic or search out lost kingdoms established millennia ago by their ancestors. This need to see a wider world is accepted by their societies as a natural part of becoming mature and experienced individuals. Such elves are expected to return in some few decades and take up lives in their homelands once more, enriched both in treasure and in worldview. For those elves raised among humans, however, life within their homes — watching friends and family swiftly age and die — is often stifling, and the ephemeral and unfettered life of an adventurer holds a natural appeal. Elves generally eschew melee because of their relative frailty, preferring instead to engage enemies at range. Most see combat as unpleasant even when needful, and prefer it be done as quickly as possible, preferably without getting close enough to smell their foes. This preference for making war at a distance, coupled with their natural accuracy and grasp of the arcane, encourages elves to pursue classes such as wizards and rangers.\n"

msgid ""
"Erastil, also known as Old Deadeye, is an ancient deity who first became known on Golarion when early humanoids began to domesticate and dominate their natural surroundings. Pastoral legends claim that Old Deadeye crafted the first bow as a gift to mortals so that they might learn to hunt and survive in the dangerous world. Though civilization has continued to advance beyond simple villages, Erastil remains popular in tradition and in the frontiers of the world, a transitional figure between the worship of the Green Faith and the religions of cities.\n"
"Erastil is primarily a nature deity focusing on the plants and animals that farmers, hunters, and ranchers deal with in their challenging lives. He is also a god of close-knit communities and families, and has a protector aspect that only surfaces when such things are threatened. Erastil eschews crusades and brazen heroism, and he has no grand plans to eradicate chaos and evil from the world; he simply wants people to be able to live their lives in peace without the threat of being devoured by monsters, conscripted into an army, or destroyed by world-ending magic. He is a stern patriarch whose spirit is as hard as wood. He isn't afraid to face down a bully, nor is he too proud to calm a frightened child. He teaches how to read the turning of the seasons, how to know when to sow and reap, how to tell when livestock are sick or gravid, how to poultice a wound and set a broken leg, how to spot a straggling sheep or the signs that a dog has gone rabid. He believes that cooperation leads to friendship and safety, and that if mortals respect the gifts of nature, it will sustain them. He loves customs that encourage strong family bonds — no matter how quaint they are by modern standards — and enjoys hunting for sustenance but not for sport. Happy weddings and new babies make him smile. He is not one to spout philosophy, and instead gives practical advice and hands-on teaching.\n"
"Old Deadeye believes that leadership is a virtue of strong souls and that groups function best when led by a benevolent leader — whether that group is his church, a community, or a family. Many communities strong in Erastil's faith follow the leadership of a village patron or matron, another elder, or the scions of a family renowned for their clearheadedness and past members' leadership roles. In Erastilian families, one family elder is likewise viewed as the leader of the clan or head of the household. The members of such groups typically defer to that leader's plan for peace and prosperity, contributing their own talents, skills, and labor for the betterment of the whole community.\n"
"Erastil believes that children should honor their parents and know when it is time to work or time to play. He dislikes the chaos and trouble that adventurers bring, and while they may have their uses when monsters come sniffing about, it is best if adventurers take care of the problem quickly, receive a meal and a place to sleep, then move on before their wanderlust catches on in otherwise quiet communities.\n"
"Erastil's avatar is an upright hunter with the head of an elk, clad in well-used leathers and carrying a simple bow. Old legends say that halflings and humans each see him as a member of their own race, even when members of both races are looking at him at the same time. Some representations show him as fully human — usually of Ulfen or Kellid heritage — depicting how he sometimes appears to children, lost travelers, or those he simply doesn't wish to reveal his divine nature to. In most stories, Old Deadeye's arrows never miss, and a few communities still own a spent arrow supposedly once fired by Erastil, passed down through the generations and treasured for its connection to the god.\n"
"Depictions of Erastil in artwork are uncommon, as his followers prefer focusing their energy on more practical matters. Those physical representations that do exist are often carved wooden placards bearing his likeness — these aren't worshiped as icons, but serve as constant reminders of his presence. In other communities, a stuffed elk's head or just its horns serve this purpose. In more elaborate representations, Erastil is shown fighting off wild animals or teaching people how to hunt. On the walls of a few ancient caves predating the Azlanti era are painted primitive silhouettes of an elk-headed man performing similar acts.\n"
"Old Deadeye shows his approval through bountiful hunts, bumper harvests, mild weather, the appearance of straight paths, and the like, but he prefers to limit his direct intervention to helping needy people in lean times, as he does not want to encourage laziness. A hungry family might find their tiny garden provides bushels of vegetables, an old cow might start giving milk again, a weary hunter's prey might stumble or become entangled, and so on. Hoofed animals are considered channels for Erastil's power, with elk-horns being favored by his worshipers for making simple tools and weapons. Forked lighting is considered a sign of his presence, and creatures or structures struck by lightning are said to have been felled by Erastil's arrows. His anger is reserved for followers who betray his principles; he usually punishes them by changing them into something more useful to their community, such as a pig or a fruit tree. Mothers often warn misbehaving children that Erastil will transform them, and most communities have at least one small, gnarled tree that local legend claims was once an especially unruly child.\n"
"Erastil's favored weapon is the longbow, but his clerics and druids are proficient with the shortbow as well. Most of his priests are clerics, but a small minority are druids, rangers, and (most rare) paladins, while a few remote communities are served by adepts. Druids usually serve communities in places where natural hazards and the weather are their greatest threats, while paladins tend to be leaders in lands where monsters lurk. Often called Old Deadeye by his faithful, Erastil is also known as Elk Father and the Old Hunter. His holy symbol is a bow made of elk antlers with a nocked arrow.\n"

"Known by many names — the Fallen, the Ash Wings, and the Furies — the devils called erinyes mock the form of the angelic hosts in their exaction of vengeance and bloody justice. Executioners, not judges,\n"
"erinyes alight upon the bladed eaves of Dis, Hell's cosmopolitan second layer, ever attentive for chances to soar into battle, whether in defense of Hell, on the whims of diabolical masters, or at the impassioned summons of jilted mortal summoners. All erinyes weave deadly living ropes from their own hair, which they use in battle to lift their foes into the air, mocking and condemning their victims for their transgressions before dropping them from great heights.\n"
"Erinyes appear as darkly beautiful angels, augmenting their sensuality with deliberate bruises and scars. Yet despite their beauty, erinyes are not seducers — they lack the subtlety and patience required for such fine emotional manipulations, and instead vastly prefer to solve their problems with swift and excruciating violence. Often, an erinyes will stay her hand before attempting to slay a foe simply so she can draw out the victim's suffering. Death is usually the only way to escape an erinyes's not-so-tender attentions, and the most powerful of these devils excel at keeping their enemies alive but helpless so as to extend their torment — many going as far as to keep their victims alive with magic. Rumors hold that the most powerful erinyes torturers have skills that allow their torment to continue even after their subject has died from their attentions.\n"
"Most erinyes stand just under 6 feet tall and weigh approximately 140 pounds, even with their blackfeathered wings that stretch over 10 feet wide."

"Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.\n"
"<b>Role:</b> Fighters excel at combat — defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.\n"

"<b>Hit Die:</b> d10\n"
"<b>Skill Ranks Per Level:</b> 1 + Int modifier\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Fighter Proficiencies</b>\n"
"A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).\n"
"<b>Bonus Combat Feat</b>\n"
"At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as Combat Feats, sometimes also called \"fighter bonus feats.\"\n"
"Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.\n"
"<b>Bravery</b>\n"
"Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on <link=\"Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw\"><b>Will saves</b></link> against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.\n"
"<b>Armor Training</b>\n"
"Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum <link=\"Encyclopedia:Dexterity\"><b>Dexterity</b></link> bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.\n"
"In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.\n"
"<b>Advanced Armor Training</b>\n"
"Beginning at 7th level, instead of increasing the benefits provided by armor training (reducing his armor's check penalty by 1 and increasing its maximum Dexterity bonus by 1), a fighter can choose an advanced armor training option (see Advanced Armor Training below) If the fighter does so, he still gains the ability to move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor at 3rd level, and while wearing heavy armor at 7th level.\n"
"<b>Weapon Training</b>\n"
"Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.\n"
"Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.\n"
"A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from his group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.\n"
"<b>Armor Mastery</b>\n"
"At 19th level, a fighter gains Damage Reduction 5/— whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.\n"
"<b>Weapon Mastery</b>\n"
"At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type."

"A hardy plant that grows in areas with poor soil but abundant animal life, this dangerous predator is an immense version of its more common (and much smaller) kin. Whereas the smaller flytraps supplement their growth by catching insects, the giant flytrap does the same with animals, humanoids, and anything else foolish enough to draw too near. Local legends call this plant names like \"mancatcher,\" \"snapperjaw plant,\" \"dragonleaf plant,\" \"cowbiter,\" and \"green gulper,\" but adventurers know it simply as the giant flytrap.\n"
"As the giant flytrap's prey are generally much smarter than insects, this huge plant has evolved into a much more aggressive hunter than its smaller brethren. It can lumber slowly along the ground, using its writhing roots like tentacles to relocate to more populous hunting grounds, and is quite canny at blending in with the surrounding foliage. A giant flytrap's jaws and stalks are swift-moving — it reaches out and snaps at passersby with lightning speed. The plant itself even has a modicum of intelligence, and is capable of limited tactical choices, such as knowing when to break off an attack against a powerful foe. While most giant flytraps have four sets of jaws, some can have as few as one, and others eight or more.\n"
"A giant flytrap's stalks are 20 feet long, but generally sprawl relatively close to the central mass — a set of full-grown f lytrap jaws is 7 feet across. A giant flytrap weighs 9,000 pounds. This towering plant is a mass of vines and barbs. Several stalks are horribly mobile, each ending in a set of green, toothy jaws."

"A frost giant's hair can be light blue or dirty yellow, and its eyes usually match its hair color. Frost giants dress in skins and pelts, along with any jewelry they own. Frost giant warriors also don chain shirts and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers. An adult male stands about 15 feet tall and weighs approximately 2,800 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical to males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old.\n"
"Frost giants are among the most feared giants, as their wanton destruction, battle lust, and fearless demeanor push them to ever-increasing displays of brutality. Frost giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes, then wading in with their enormous greataxes. A favorite tactic is to lay an ambush by hiding buried in the snow at the top of an icy or snowy slope, where opponents will have difficulty reaching them, and then starting an avalanche before leaping into battle. Frost giants can hide well in snowy environments and are masters of stealth in their domain.\n"
"Frost giants survive on hunting and raiding alone, as they live in desolate, frigid environments. Frost giant groups are split almost evenly between those that live in makeshift settlements or abandoned castles and those that roam the frozen north as nomads in search of spoils and provisions. Frost giant leaders call themselves jarls and demand absolute obedience from their followers. At any time a jarl may be challenged by combat for leadership of the tribe. These challenges typically result in the death of one of the combatants. A single jarl can often count a dozen or more smaller frost giant tribes as part of his extended tribe. In such a situation, the leaders of the lesser tribes are known simply as chieftains or warlords.\n"
"Frost giants love to take captives, and use them for food as well as slaves and commodities. Every group of frost giants typically has 1–2 humanoid slaves shackled to a slave handler — usually the meanest and cruelest non-jarl in the group. They are also quite fond of monstrous pets — white dragons and winter wolves are popular choices, but remorhazes, yetis, and even linnorms can be found dwelling in a frost giant lair."

"<b>Physical Description:</b>\n"
"Gnomes are one of the smallest of the common races, generally standing just over 3 feet in height. Despite their small frames, however, gnomes are extremely resilient, and not as weak as many of their foes assume. Though their diminutive stature reduces their ability to move quickly, gnomes often train to take advantage of their size, especially when fighting foes much larger than themselves.\n"
"The coloration of gnomes varies so wildly that many outsiders assume gnomes commonly use dyes and illusions to change their skin and hair tones. While gnomes are certainly not above cosmetic enhancement (and may wish to change their appearance just to see how outlandish they can look), their natural hues truly range over a rainbow of coloration. Their hair tends toward vibrant colors such as the fiery orange of autumn leaves, the verdant green of forests at springtime, or the deep reds and purples of wildflowers in bloom. Similarly, their flesh tones range from earthy browns to floral pinks, and gnomes with black, pastel blue, or even green skin are not unknown. Gnomes' coloration has little regard for heredity, with the color of a gnome's parents and other kin having no apparent bearing on the gnome's appearance.\n"
"Gnomes possess highly mutable facial characteristics, and their proportions often don't match the norm of other humanoid races. Many have overly large mouths and eyes, an effect which can be both disturbing and stunning, depending on the individual. Others may have extremely small features spread over an otherwise blank expanse of face, or may mix shockingly large eyes with a tiny, pursed mouth and a pert button of a nose. Gnomes rarely take pride in or show embarrassment about their features, but members of other races often fixate on a gnome's most prominent feature and attempt to use it as the focus of insults or endearments.\n"
"<b>Society:</b>\n"
"Unlike most races, gnomes do not generally organize themselves within classic societal structures. Gnome cities are unusual and gnome kingdoms almost unknown. Further, gnomes have no particular tendency to gather in specific neighborhoods even when a large number of them live among other races. While specific laws meant to contain the potential impact of gnomes on a society may require a \"gnome quarter,\" and societal pressure sometimes causes all non-gnomes to move away from areas with high gnome populations, left to their own devices, gnomes tend to spread evenly throughout communities that allow them.\n"
"However, even when gnomes are common within a community as a group, individual gnomes tend to be always on the move. Whimsical creatures at heart, they typically travel alone or with temporary companions, ever seeking new and more exciting experiences. They rarely form enduring relationships among themselves or with members of other races, instead pursuing crafts, professions, or collections with a passion that borders on zealotry. If a gnome does settle in an area or stay with a group for a longer period, it is almost always the result of some benefit that area gives to a vocation or obsession to which the gnome had dedicated himself.\n"
"Despite their extremely varied backgrounds and lack of a unifying homeland, gnomes do possess some common cultural traits. Male gnomes have a strange fondness for unusual hats and headgear, often wearing the most expensive and ostentatious head-covering they can afford (and that their chosen careers will allow them to wear without causing problems). Females rarely cover their heads, but proudly wear elaborate and eccentric hairstyles that often include intricate jeweled combs and headpieces.\n"
"<b>Relations:</b>\n"
"Gnomes have difficulty interacting with the other races, on both emotional and physical levels. In many ways, the very fact other races see gnomes as odd is itself the thing gnomes find most odd about other races, and this leads to a strong lack of common ground upon which understanding, and relationships can be built. When two gnomes encounter one another, they generally assume some mutually beneficial arrangement can be reached, no matter how different their beliefs and traditions may be. Even if this turns out not to be the case, the gnomes continue to look for commonalities in their dealings with each other. The inability or unwillingness of members of other races to make the same effort when dealing with gnomes is both frustrating and confusing to most gnomes.\n"
"In many ways, it is gnomes' strong connection to a wide range of apparently unconnected ideas that makes it difficult for other races to build relationships with them. Gnome humor, for example, is often focused on physical pranks, nonsensical rhyming nicknames, and efforts to convince others of outrageous lies that strain all credibility. Gnomes find such efforts hysterically funny, but their pranks often come across as malicious or senseless to other races, while gnomes, in turn, tend to think of the taller races as dull and lumbering giants.\n"
"Gnomes get along reasonably well with halflings and humans, who at least have some traditions of bizarre, gnomelike humor. Gnomes generally feel dwarves and half-orcs need to lighten up, and attempt to bring levity into their lives with tricks, jokes, and outrageous tales the more dour races simply cannot see the sense of. Gnomes respect elves, but often grow frustrated with the slow pace at which members of the long-lived race make decisions. To gnomes, action is always better than inaction, and many gnomes carry several highly involved projects with them at all times to keep themselves entertained during rest periods.\n"
"<b>Alignment and Religion:</b>\n"
"Although gnomes are impulsive tricksters, with sometimes inscrutable motives and equally confusing methods, their hearts are generally in the right place. What may seem a malicious act to a non-gnome is more likely an effort to introduce new acquaintances to new experiences, however unpleasant the experiences may be. Gnomes are prone to powerful fits of emotion, and find themselves most at peace within the natural world.\n"
"<b>Adventurers:</b>\n"
"Gnomes' propensity for wanderlust, deep curiosity, and desire to master odd or esoteric skills and languages make them natural adventurers. They often become wanderers to experience new aspects of life, for nothing is as novel as the uncounted dangers facing adventurers. Many gnomes see adventuring as the only worthwhile purpose in life, and seek out adventures for no other motive than to experience them. Other gnomes desire to find some lost lore or material that has ties to their chosen vocation and believe only dragon hoards and ancient ruins can contain the lore they need, which can result in gnomes who think of themselves as bakers or weavers being just as accomplished adventurers as those who declare themselves to be mages or scouts.\n"
"Gnomes are physically weak compared to many races, and see this as a simple fact of life to be planned for accordingly. Most adventuring gnomes make up for their weakness with a proclivity for sorcery or bardic music, while others turn to alchemy or exotic weapons to grant them an edge in conflicts.\n"

"<b>Physical Description:</b>\n"
"Goblins are short, ugly humanoids that stand just over 3 feet tall. Their scrawny bodies are topped with over-sized and usually hairless heads with massive ears and beady red or occasionally yellow eyes. Goblins' skin tone varies based on the surrounding environment; common skin tones include green, gray, and blue, though black and even pale white goblins have been sighted. Their voracious appetites are served well by their huge mouths filled with jagged teeth.\n"
"<b>Society:</b>\n"
"Violent but fecund, goblins exist in primitive tribal structures with constant shifts in power. Rarely able to sustain their own needs through farming or hunting and gathering, goblin tribes live where food is abundant or near places that they can steal it from. Since they are incapable of building significant fortifications and have been driven out of most easily accessible locations, goblins tend to live in unpleasant and remote locations, and their poor building and planning skills ensure that they dwell primarily in crude caves, ramshackle villages, and abandoned structures. Few goblins are good with tools or skilled at farming, and the rare items of any value that they possess are usually cast-off implements from humans or other civilized cultures. Goblins' appetites and poor planning lead to small tribes dominated by the strongest warriors. Even the hardiest goblin leaders quickly find out that their survival depends on conducting frequent raids to secure sources of food and kill off the more aggressive youth of the tribe. Both goblin men and women are ugly and vicious, and both sexes are just as likely to rise to positions of power in a tribe. Goblin babies are almost completely self-sufficient not long after birth, and such infants are treated almost like pets. Many tribes raise their children communally in cages or pens where adults can largely ignore them. Mortality is high among young goblins, and when the adults fail to feed them or food runs low, youths learn at an early age that cannibalism is sometimes the best means of survival in a goblin tribe.\n"
"<b>Relations:</b>\n"
"Goblins tend to view other beings as sources of food, which makes for poor relations with most civilized races. Goblins often survive on the fringes of <link=\"Encyclopedia:Humans\"><b>human</b></link> civilization, preying on weak or lost travelers and occasionally raiding small settlements to fuel their voracious appetites. They have a special animosity toward <link=\"Encyclopedia:Gnomes\"><b>gnomes</b></link>, and celebrate the capturing or killing of such victims with a feast. Of the most common races, <link=\"Encyclopedia:Half-orcs\"><b>half-orcs</b></link> are the most tolerant of goblins, sharing a similar ancestry and experiencing the same hatred within many societies. Goblins are mostly unaware of half-orcs‘ sympathy, however, and avoid them because they are larger, meaner, and less flavorful than other humanoids.\n"
"<b>Alignment and Religion:</b>\n"
"Goblins are greedy, capricious, and destructive by nature, and thus most are neutral or <link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\"><b>chaotic evil</b></link>.\n"
"<b>Adventurers:</b>\n"
"Goblin adventurers are usually curious and inclined to explore the world, though they are often killed off by their own foolish misdeeds or hunted down for their random acts of destruction. Their pernicious nature makes interacting with civilized races almost impossible, so goblins tend to adventure on the fringes of civilization or in the wilds. Adventurous individuals who survive long enough often ride goblin dogs or other exotic mounts, and focus on archery to avoid close confrontation with larger enemies. goblin spellcasters prefer fire magic and bombs over almost all other methods of spreading mayhem.\n"

"Goblins prefer to dwell in caves, amid large and dense thickets of thistles and brambles, or in structures built and then abandoned by others. Very few goblins have the drive to build structures of their own. Coastlines are favored, as goblins are quite fond of sifting through junk and f lotsam in an unending quest to find treasures among the refuse of more civilized races.\n"
"Goblin hatred runs deep, and few things inspire their wrath more than gnomes (who have long fought against goblins), horses (who frighten goblins tremendously), and regular dogs (whom goblins regard as pale imitations of goblin dogs).\n"
"Goblins are also quite superstitious, and treat magic with a fawning mixture of awe and fear. They have the habit of ascribing magic to the mundane as well, with fire and writing both taking on mystical power in goblin society. Fire is much loved by goblins for its capacity to wreak great destruction and because it doesn't require size or strength to wield, but written words are hated. Goblins believe that writing steals words out of your head, and as a result of this belief, goblins are universally illiterate.\n"
"Goblins are voracious and can eat their body weight in food daily without growing fat. Goblin lairs always have numerous storerooms and larders. While they prefer human and gnome flesh, a goblin won't turn down any food — except, perhaps, vegetables."

"Said to have been born from the first battles between humans and orcs, Gorum appears as a suit of spiked plate armor with blazing red eyes. Though claimed by half-orcs, humans, and orcs as one of their own, the god cares nothing for these divisions except insofar as they relate to battle and strife. He believes in strength and power, the verdict of the sword, and the music of clashing iron. He does not favor good or evil, and the only right he confers upon mortals is the right to fight for their next breath. As long as people struggle against themselves and each other, Gorum's teachings live on. The greatest moments in a Gorumite's life are those spent locked in close combat, with every moment threatening annihilation — all else is dull and dreary.\n"
"When the dwarves drove the orcs upward out of the Darklands and onto the surface world in their legendary Quest for Sky, the savage hordes fought with primitive human tribes that were all that remained of the broken human empires. In an era of conflict and bloodshed, new pains and passions unknown in all the centuries before broke forth in mortal souls and carved themselves in broken flesh. Before this conflict, his name was not known, but as human clashed with orc, Gorum rose into prominence as the divine personification of horrible, exhilarating war. Wherever was has risen throughout the world ever since, Gorum has been there to inspire mortals to greatness on the battlefield. Under his iron gaze, the worthy find glory — and those who fall are forgotten.\n"
"Gorum's priests believe that if the world ever became free of war, his spirit would abandon Golarion in disgust, but he would eagerly return should mortals ever take up arms again. Despite advances in magic, technology, and the tools of war, Our Lord in Iron is remarkably constant, for his focus is on battle itself, not the reasons for it or the types of weapons used. Whether a battle is between orcs and humans, goblins and dwarves, or elves and creatures from beyond the stars, Gorum is there to glory in the vital energy of conflict.\n"
"Gorum's entire focus is on battle and the crucible of struggle. He understands the need for archery, siege weapons, and stealth, but nothing satisfies him more than face-to-face melee combat in which sweat, blood, and fear fog the air. While Torag represents the tactical side of war, and Sarenrae its necessity as a last resort when evil cannot be stopped in any other way, Gorum is the excitement, battle-lust, and brutality of combat. He is indifferent to whether his followers are knights in plate mail, goblins wielding dogslicers, or children armed with table knives — anyone willing to put up a fight, no matter how pathetic or pointless, is worth swinging at. He does not condone the wild slaughter of innocents and invalids, for such acts are the parlance of murderers and butchers, not of warriors. Likewise, he can be merciful, giving quarter to those who surrender, but he is quick to slay any who pretend to submit in the hope of striking while the superior opponent is unaware, and those who refuse to fight at all are barely worth a scornful beheading.\n"
"It is more pleasing to Gorum to see a soldier fight a score of battles in his lifetime than die in the first, and if compromises or truces mean warriors live on to fight again, he supports diplomacy over seeing every soldier fight to a pointless death, but he doesn't care for negotiations and quickly loses interest when tempers cool and blades are sheathed. Battles of words and wits tire him, not because he lacks the intellect for them, but because he finds them as pointless and unsatisfying as crushing ants — true challenges are those where lives are on the line and a moment's hesitation can mean blood and pain. As good and evil have little meaning for him, he may fight demons one day and noble dragons another, just to challenge himself and test his own mettle. Among other deities, Gorum is seen as warrior with few equals, but prone to rage and destruction when he grows bored.\n"
"Artistic depictions of Gorum are uncommon, as his followers prefer mighty deeds and boastful words to quieter, more permanent works of art. Of the depictions that are created, however, his image, shape, or shadow is often drawn in blood or hammered together out of scraps of metal. A few temples with forges have molds for casting weapons, and the spillover channels in the molds lead to hand-sized receptacles shaped like spiked, armored men with Gorum's symbol on their chests. These heavy, inadvertently created icons of the faith are used both as holy symbols and for focusing group prayers before battle.\n"
"Gorum shows his favor through iron armor or weapons that gleam or leak blood when touched. Certain legendary warriors are known for leaving a trail of blood and gore behind them even when not in battle, and sometimes a favored, lone warrior outnumbered by a superior force manages to survive because his enemies slip on the blood-slick bodies of the dead. Gorum's anger most often manifests in sudden patches of rust that appear to completely ruin a valued weapon or piece of armor, and he has been known to punish a cowardly warrior by causing his armor to fall apart into a pile of rusty scraps just as enemies converge on him. His holy symbol is a mountaintop with an enormous sword jutting from it.\n"

"Gozreh is timeless. Born when the first breeze caressed the ocean, she is ever changing, tempestuous, and unpredictable, yet also prone to periods of constancy, stillness, and routine. He is the storm cloud chased by clear skies, the spring warmth that follows winter, and the fair winds that carry seagoing ships. She is the great wave that capsizes those ships, the gentle current that deposits sailors on safe shores, and the rising and falling tides. Those who ply the waters or rely upon the rains know this better than most, and are sure to placate Gozreh and honor him when the wind and waves are favorable.\n"
"Gozreh has two aspects, equally depicted in art and sculpture. When at sea or over water, Gozreh is a woman with wild, flowing green hair, whose body transforms into endless waves. In the sky and over land, Gozreh appears as an aged man with a long white beard, emerging from a mighty storm cloud. Gozreh is moody and brooding, able to spend weeks in a glowering quiet only to explode in a fury of water, wind, and lightning. He is an elemental force, not fettered by the work of mortals; he may turn aside his wrath when appeased with gifts and flattering words, or he may ignore mortal cries entirely. Many cargo ships throw a crate or two overboard in the deep ocean to satisfy her, so that she does not take more by force. He is the amoral side of nature, that which brings life and takes it unexpectedly. Gozreh represents both female and male facets of life, unconstrained by civilization's notions of masculinity and femininity. Grandmother, grandfather, brother, sister, eternal and ever changing, the Wind and the Waves echo and shape the countless living things on Golarion.\n"
"Gozreh refers to himself or herself as \"I\" or \"We\" interchangeably. He loves to race the wind, tearing clouds in two with his passing, or sculpting them into islands and palaces for his pleasure. She hides under the waves and plummets to the crushing depths of the ocean, chasing whales and building grottoes visible only by the light of the glowing creatures that live there. He hates those who defile the sky with smoke, taint the waters with mortal filth, or abuse the bounties of land and sea. Her official church is small, but her lay worshipers are countless. He particularly likes seabirds, flying fish, and frogs, both as living specimens and as sacrificial offerings. He is known to watch the world through the eyes of beasts, whether on the wing or under the sea, flitting from the body of a solitary bear to the countless beating hearts of a flock of starlings. He senses the day and night through green plants and pale fungi, drinking deeply through the roots of the mighty oak or clinging to a stone as the tiniest moss or lichen.\n"
"Gozreh's interests lie entirely in the realm of weather and living things. He has little interest in earth except in the form of soil or as a foundation for living works. She cares naught for fire save for how flame and ash provide opportunities for new life to grow in their wake. These materials are not taboo to her faithful, just inconsequential. Likewise, he accepts that some creatures must die so that others may survive and still others be born, but the mystical aspects of death and its cycles do not concern him — he leaves these things to entities such as Pharasma. Like nature itself, Gozreh can be cruel and indifferent, allowing a storm to ravage the land or sink a dozen ships, or a plague to wipe out an entire herd of animals or even whole settlements. Yet she also pushes trading ships across the world, multiplies animals in springtime, and brings gentle rain to thirsty fields. His way is a way beyond morals and ethics — as long as life survives in some form, and water and weather support it and keep the world itself dynamic, Gozreh is satisfied. Though her priests and priestesses may have personal ideas about which creatures should live and which should not, or visions of what Gozreh wants protected or destroyed, they accept that their beliefs are just one facet of their deity's infinite perceptions.\n"
"The Wind and the Waves may be intractable one moment and sympathetic the next. He does not do this to be deliberately contrary or mischievous, or in the interest of chaos; it is simply because he perceives everything — every living organism, every drop of water, every gust of wind — at all times. Events distant and unrelated may draw her attention, and the outcome of those events may change her mood, whether because a potential tornado disperses too soon or a rare breed of fox births a dozen healthy kits. He is a great monarch, constantly beseeched by courtiers and commoners, listening to each argument simultaneously and shifting his attention and response to each in turn. To one unaware of the cacophony, she may appear flighty or distracted, but the truth is far more complicated, in a way that mortal cannot hope to perceive.\n"
"Gozreh is usually depicted as a colossal humanoid whose lower half trails away into a mass of roiling elemental matter. In male form, he appears as a storm cloud and always remains flying — according to one old legend, he can stretch from one horizon to the other, darkening the entire sky with his fury. In female form, Gozreh's body is usually shown blending with the water of a lake or sea. She has been known to rise from a waterspout, but sometimes gathers all the nearby water into a great wave, emerging from the top as a nymph-like shape, a crone, or a vaguely humanoid construct of pure water.\n"
"Statues of Gozreh are usually made of driftwood or lightning-scorched trees either tied together into a humanoid shapes or carved to resemble one or both incarnations; a few are chiseled from ice and either magically preserved or allowed to melt to be recreated as needed. Stone is rarely used for religious imagery, and never brick or pottery, as such things are signs of civilization's encroachment. Holy symbols and small idols may be made of coral, polished shell, lacquered wood, whalebone, and other materials that represent life in the sea and the sky that have naturally fallen.\n"
"Signs of Gozreh's favor include a sudden gentle breeze that carries the scent of flowers, the appearance of large numbers of animals, the unexplained sound of waves crashing on a distant beach, and dreams of a specific, recognizable animal (such as a white wolf, a frilled lizard with glowing blue eyes, or a ghostly raven). Omens of his displeasure include being watched and shrieked at by wild birds or beasts, sudden rainstorms localized over a specific building or individual, or an unending taste of blood in the mouth. She may foul fresh water, or afflict offenders with terrible smells or excruciating joint pain as the weather changes.\n"
"It's not unusual for zealous priests of Gozreh to remain celibate, devoting all their energy to their deity; these priests have been known to worship their deity naked in high places or shallow waters — a process referred to as becoming \"sky-clad\" or \"sea-clad.\" Priests have a habit of finding discarded things washed up or left on the shore, including infants orphaned by shipwrecks or abandoned to die from exposure; in most lands, such children are traditionally raised by the church and trained for the priesthood, which offsets the low number of children born to priests because of their high celibacy rate.\n"
"Gozreh's holy symbol is a green leaf with a drop of water pouring from the lower end. Most of Gozreh's priests are clerics, but about a tenth are druids, with a few rangers (\"weather-hunters\") and adepts taking active roles in the priesthood. Inquisitors are rare; those who embrace this a path seek out folk who pollute water, clear-cut forests, and abuse the natural creatures of the world.\n"

"Groetus is an apocalyptic god of unknown origins, perhaps predating the current incarnation of the planes. Enigmatic and malevolent, he remains infinitely patient in the face of an indefinite vigil to fulfill his mysterious purpose. Because he does not actively cultivate worshipers, much of what is known about him and his faith is limited and contradictory, built from secondhand lore repeated by scattered — and mostly insane — followers. Most folk pay him no heed or give him only scant consideration, for tangible and immediate threats are far more pressing than a god of the death of all things. This doesn't bother Groetus, for he knows the end times will come, whether mortals believe in him or not.\n"
"There are records that Groetus was worshiped in Azlanti and Thassilonian times, though he has no known kinship to Golarion's other gods and there is no evidence he was once a mortal or nature spirit. The proteans and qlippoth have no tales of his appearance or of a time before he existed.\n"
"Groetus presides over the end times — the demise of the world, or perhaps the destruction of the multiverse itself. Having silently witnessed billions of souls from countless worlds filter through the Boneyard, he is unconcerned with the fates of individual heroes, villages, or even civilizations. Despite his chaotic alignment, he is an agent of inevitable fate, ensuring that all things pass. He chose this role for himself, the dispassionate observer in balance against the dispassionate judge. Groetus's role is to close the book on this reality when the final page of its story is told. He knows only how the story ends, and uses that knowledge to piece together what is yet to come — a conflict occurs, this entity survives until the end of the story, this other entity does not, and so on — and what to do next once the tale is finished. His attention is on the final goal and the cosmic dynamics that may enable or delay that goal: the subtle movement of planes against each other, the brooding thoughts of rising gods, and the births and deaths of stars in the remote expanse of space.\n"
"Groetus rarely appears in human form, but a few records from ancient Azlant describe him as a tall, slender man wearing a gray, cowled robe that hangs heavily to the floor. He is slightly bent at the neck, as if bearing a great weight on his head, with ashen skin, hollow eyes, and long, smooth hands. His voice is the dry whisper of old paper, his laughter low and breathy, and his inflection archaic or foreign. His feet are bare and covered in soot, as if he had walked through an extinguished fire.\n"
"Groetus almost never intervenes directly in the mortal world, as if doing so were against some selfdefined code. His rare intervention on behalf of his prophets grants them a few moments of clarity at those critical times when madness would interfere with his intentions. When he is displeased, madness intensifies, phobias are born or triggered, and eyes become cloudy or weep itchy gray fluid.\n"
"Just as there are dozens of world-ending prophecies and the exact definition of \"the end of all things\" varies among religions and races, there are many interpretations of Groetus's role. Most of his cultists follow one of these ideologies (called \"dooms\"), and each doom can be considered a splinter cult of the god's vague faith. Cultists' identification with particular dooms is generally a reflection of the cultists' particular forms of madness and the visions these insanities inspire. Two worshipers with different ideologies may ally with or ignore each other, but rarely do they fight, for time will prove one or both of them wrong.\n"

msgid ""
"The goddess Gyronna plays shepherd to wayward hate and coddles the entitlement and darkness in mortal hearts. The superstitious and crass describe Gyronna as both the Angry Hag and the Hag Queen, goddess of scorned women. While her priesthood does consist largely of women used and cast aside by society, she represents a much darker impulse than mere wounded pride. Gyronna is the briar that springs from bitter soil; her purview is not scorn, but the hatred that festers around a wounded heart never allowed to heal and the dread things that grow from small and thoughtless evils. When trust and love fail, her embrace fills that void with the strength of seething vengeance and bitter entitlement.\n"
"Few sources agree on Gyronna's origin, and her cults quietly hunt anyone who investigates it. Many place her origins in the First World, as a malicious fey princess who delighted in manipulation for her own amusement. After crossing a powerful rival — Baba Yaga or Magdh, by most accounts — the immortal dilettante was punished with deformities and cast into the mortal realm. Other stories describe her as a trio of bickering sisters who befell the same fate, and were so mutilated that they were forced to lean on one another to even stand, eventually growing together into one loathsome, hateful whole. In the wake of such exile, kindness and civility are, to her, dribbles of poisoned honey, and Gyronna would burn all the world to ash to eradicate such mockery and deception.\n"
"Gyronna's complete figure is rarely depicted; she is more often represented as the same bloodshot eye her followers use as their unholy symbol. Her rare manifestations are chaotic, shifting form mid-conversation — sometimes decrepit, other times vibrantly young, beautiful, withered and dead, jubilant, weeping, or raging. According to ancient tales, the Angry Hag has no true form beyond the singular bulging eye through which she sees the shadows cast by even the brightest lights. Only her gender remains constant — though she presents vastly differing images of womanhood — as do the ragged vestments in which she wraps herself.\n"
"The Angry Hag's favor is felt in misfortune befalling those who vex her followers, or in small, suffering animals left in one's home by stray cats. Those who earn her ire can expect minor social blunders to grow far beyond their expected scope, premature aging, or for their touch to wither plants and sicken animals.\n"
"Order and hierarchy disgust Gyronna, and her faith is one of hidden cults — referred to as circles — spread by hushed whispers and desperate midnight indoctrinations. Her teachings emphasize personal fulfillment and rejection of the hollow trappings of society unless they suit one's needs. Chief among her cultists are women in troubled marriages, who have found themselves either betrayed by the person they trusted most in the world, or punished and exiled from their community for betraying that same trust. The hurt from such encounters, or similar rejections and violations of trust, plants the seed Gyronna's faith cultivates into poisonous fruit. No wound of spite is unjustified and no price of revenge is too high; all past agony demands new suffering from others.\n"
"Individual adherents may act openly or in secret, but circles of Gyronnans nearly always meet in seclusion, concealing their identities under hoods or behind masks. Meeting by night in untamed wilderness or in crumbling structures where vermin and rot dominate, her faithful trade secrets, offer prayers and sacrifices, exchange poisons and black magic, and cajole one another into assisting with personal rituals or plots. Leadership is determined by whichever member can cow her sisters into compliance or recruit enough followers to overpower challengers. Hags or cruel changelings often lead a circle, while a full hag coven may command large and influential cults to act as their eyes and ears across a broader area. In such cases, Gyronna's mortal worshipers serve almost entirely as agents for their mistress's whims, helping to enact schemes, secure victims for torture, and kidnap healthy infants to exchange for their own changeling brood.\n"
"Gyronna's faith consists almost entirely of women, but is by no means a religion that glorifies or protects her chosen gender. Women outside her faith — and even the unwary within it — are considered apt targets for violence, extortion, and curses. Key among her philosophy is nurturing the entitlement that accompanies a life touched by wealth, beauty, or political power, and her church has little use for the poor or other groups forced to society's margins. While the bitter-hearted among these groups may participate in her cults, they rarely earn the goddess's favor or any measure of influence unless they also wield formidable magical abilities. Her cult has no particular interest in challenging gender-related prejudices or improving the lot of women in general; most would rather use oppressive gender roles or assumptions to conceal their activities or lay a foundation of hatred in potential future converts.\n"
"While Gyronna's worship is predominantly practiced by women, this is more because the goddess finds the anger of men to be blunt and clumsy. She is a vintner of malevolence, keen to grow a cold, bitter heart over months or years, and has no use for worshipers who fall prey to the self-aggrandizement or lack of self-awareness she believes men embody. She is known to strike those men who beg her favor with impotence, claiming it calms their temperament. The threat of such a result drives most men away, but a select few find her potential support for their vendettas and resentment to be worth the risk, and eventually find a place within her cult.\n"
"As Gyronna is a secretive and paranoid goddess, her followers rarely construct elaborate temples. Instead, they claim sites of great natural beauty that are isolated from prying eyes, and dedicate them to the Angry Hag. Each site is christened with an altar of piled stones, capped with a fist-sized stone painted to resemble an eye, or with an enormous gem, among more influential circles. Followers claim that Gyronna — as well as any hags who serve the cult — can see through these stones to cast judgment and dispense curses. Especially ambitious circles have been known to erect elaborate monuments or rings of standing stones upon sites of natural wonder in mockery of the fey or druidic protectors from whom they seized these sites.\n"
"Sites frequented by Gyronna's priestesses develop a dimness and dankness that meld into a sense of looming dread. Venomous creatures and plants flourish in and around her shrines. Adherents of the Angry Hag mark these spaces in ways obvious only to the faithful. In urban settings, these demarcations appear as motifs of three concentric circles — resembling an eye — worked into decorations and stonework, while in rural environs a circle may hang woven spheres or circles from tree branches or paint eye imagery onto trees and rocks. Such territorial markings are intended to warn off other Gyronnans, but cultists consider such subtle and contextual messages to be sufficient warnings for all trespassers, and maintain that any who stumble into their territory deserve whatever fate befalls them.\n"

"Also known as black hags or iron hags, annis hags are the largest and most physically intimidating of their foul brood. Known for their iron-hard, wart-covered skin that varies from shades of deep blue to black and their claws like rusty blades, annis hags forgo much of the cunning and deceptiveness of their kind to revel in the more visceral evils of torture and slaughter. The typical annis hag stands just over 8 feet tall and weighs upward of 300 pounds.\n"
"Dwelling in dark caves, tangled hollows, and cursed ruins deep within frozen swamps or icy moors, annis hags stalk forth by night to sow fear and hunt the unwary. Although possessed of cunning minds, annis prove more decadent than most other hags, frequently indulging in their taste for living flesh and the music of pleading screams. Unlike green hags, they use their ability to assume humanoid form via alter self not to infiltrate societies but to lure victims into a false sense of security before attacking — often posing as travelers in need of aid or pilgrims seeking to share a camp.\n"
"Annis hags find the flesh of children, young animals, and the pure of heart particularly pleasing, both for the tenderness of such meals and for the sorrow such murders spread. After gorging themselves, these hags delight in stripping the skin from their victims, often garbing themselves in the grisly trophies. They are also known to retain and even preserve identifiable portions of their victims (such as heads) for later use in spreading misery. An annis who eats the children of a local farmer might keep the heads (or at least the faces) handy to return to the victims' parents, for example — often in the guise of an anonymous gift. The most insidious of annis hags present these gifts in ways that implicate friends or family in the victim's death.\n"
"Like most hags, annis sometimes join covens of their repulsive sisters, though many prove resistant to such cooperation. They are particularly unlikely to join covens that already include other annis, though groups of related annis — typically horrible triplets — are not unknown. A typical annis coven consists of one annis leader along with two green hags or sometimes even a witch or two. Annis covens often seek to recruit additional creatures as guardians and are particularly fond of trolls and ogres for such roles."

"<b>Physical Description:</b>\n"
"Half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their elven lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by their human side. While half-elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes tend to be human-like in shape, but feature an exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue. This pattern changes for half-elves of drow descent, however. Such elves are almost unfailingly marked with the white or silver hair of the drow parent, and more often than not have dusky gray skin that takes on a purplish or bluish tinge in the right light, while their eye color usually favors that of the human parent.\n"
"<b>Society:</b>\n"
"Their lack of a unified homeland and culture forces half-elves to remain versatile, able to conform to nearly any environment. While often considered attractive to both races for the same reasons as their parents, half-elves rarely fit in with either humans or elves, as both races see too much evidence of the other in them. This lack of acceptance weighs heavily on many half-elves, yet others are bolstered by their unique status, seeing in their lack of a formalized culture the ultimate freedom. As a result, half-elves are incredibly adaptable, capable of adjusting their mindsets and talents to whatever societies they find themselves in. Even half-elves welcomed by one side of their heritage often find themselves caught between cultures, as they are encouraged, cajoled, or even forced into taking on diplomatic responsibilities between human and elven kind. Many half-elves rise to the occasion of such service, seeing it as a chance to prove their worth to both races. Others, however, come to resent the pressures and presumptions foisted upon them by both races and turn any opportunity to broker power, make peace, or advance trade between humans and elves into an exercise in personal profit.\n"
"<b>Relations:</b>\n"
"Half-elves understand loneliness, and know that character is often less a product of race than of life experience. As such, they are often open to friendships and alliances with other races, and less likely than most to rely on first impressions when forming opinions of new acquaintances. While many races join together to produce mixed offspring of notable power, such as <link=\"Encyclopedia:Half-orcs\"><b>half-orcs</b></link>, half-dragons, and half-fiends, half-elves seem to have a unique position in the eyes of their progenitors and the rest of the world. Those <link=\"Encyclopedia:Humans\"><b>humans</b></link> who admire elvenkind see half-elves as a living link or bridge between the two races. But this attitude often foists unfair expectations and elevated standards upon half-elves, and quickly turns to derision when they do not live up to the grand destinies that others set for them. Additionally, those half-elves raised by or in the company of elves often have the human half of their parentage dubbed a mere obstacle, something to be overcome with proper immersion and schooling in the elven ways, and even the most well-meaning elven mentors often push their half-elven charges to reject a full half of themselves in order to \"better\" themselves.\n"
"<link=\"Encyclopedia:Dwarves\"><b>Dwarves</b></link>, despite their traditional mistrust of elves, see a half-elf's human parentage as something hopeful, and treat them as half-humans rather than half-elves. Additionally, while dwarves are long-lived, the lifespan of the stout folk is closer to a half-elf's own than that of either of her parents. As a result, half-elves and dwarves often form lasting bonds, be they ones of friendship, business, or even competitive rivalry.\n"
"<link=\"Encyclopedia:Gnomes\"><b>Gnomes</b></link> and <link=\"Encyclopedia:Halflings\"><b>halflings</b></link> often see half-elves as a curiosity. Those half-elves who have seen themselves pushed to the edges of society, truly without a home, typically find gnomes and halflings frivolous and worthy of disdain, but secretly envy their seemingly carefree ways. Clever and enterprising gnomes and halflings sometimes partner with a half-elf for adventures or even business ventures, using the half-elf's participation to lend their own endeavors an air of legitimacy that they cannot acquire on their own.\n"
"Perhaps the most peculiar and dichotomous relations exist between half-elves and <link=\"Encyclopedia:Half-orcs\"><b>half-orcs</b></link>. Those half-orcs and half-elves who were raised among their non-human kin normally see one another as hated and ancient foes. However, half-elves who have been marginalized by society feel a deep, almost instant kinship with half-orcs, knowing their burdens are often that much harder because of their appearance and somewhat brutish nature. Not all half-orcs are inclined or able to understand such empathy, but those who do often find themselves with a dedicated diplomat, liaison, and apologist. For their own part, half-orcs usually return the favor by acting as bodyguards or intimidators, and take on other roles uniquely suited to their brawny forms.\n"
"<b>Alignment and Religion:</b>\n"
"Half-elves' isolation strongly influences their characters and philosophies. Cruelty does not come naturally to them, nor does blending in or bending to the societal convention—as a result, most half-elves are chaotic good. Half-elves' lack of a unified culture makes them less likely to turn to religion, but those who do generally follow the common faiths of their homeland. Others come to religion and worship later in their lives, especially if they have been made to feel part of a community through faith or the work of clerical figures. Some half-elves feel the pull of the divine but live beyond the formal religious instruction of society. Such individuals often worship ideas and concepts like freedom, harmony, or balance, or the primal forces of the world. Still, others gravitate toward long-forgotten gods, finding comfort and kinship in the idea that even deities can be overlooked.\n"
"<b>Adventurers:</b>\n"
"Half-elves tend to be itinerants, wandering the lands in search of a place they might finally call home. The desire to prove themselves to the community and establish a personal identity—or even a legacy—drives many half-elf adventurers to lives of bravery. Some half-elves claim that despite their longevity, they perceive the passage of time more like humans than elves, and are driven to amass wealth, power, or fame early on in life so they may spend the rest of their years enjoying it.\n"

"<b>Society:</b>\n"
"Unlike half-elves, where at least part of society's discrimination is born out of jealousy or attraction, half-orcs get the worst of both worlds: physically weaker than their orc kin, they also tend to be feared or attacked outright by humans who don't bother making the distinction between full orcs and half-bloods. Even on the best of terms, half-orcs in civilized societies are not exactly accepted, and tend to be valued only for their physical abilities. On the other hand, orc leaders have been known to deliberately spawn half-orcs, as the half-breeds make up for their lack of physical strength with increased cunning and aggression, making them natural leaders and strategic advisors. Within orc tribes, half-orcs find themselves constantly striving to prove their worth in battle and with feats of strength. Half-orcs raised within orc tribes are more likely to file their tusks and cover themselves in tribal tattoos. Tribal leaders quietly recognize that half-orcs are often more clever than their orc cousins and often apprentice them to the tribe's shaman, where their cunning might eventually strengthen the tribe. Apprenticeship to a shaman is a brutal and often short-lived distinction, however, and those half-orcs who survive it either become influential in the tribe or are eventually driven to leave.\n"
"Half-orcs have a much more mixed experience in human society, where many cultures view them as little more than monsters. They often are unable even to get normal work, and are pressed into service in the military or sold into slavery. In these cultures, half-orcs often lead furtive lives, hiding their nature whenever possible. The dark underworld of society is often the most welcoming place, and many half-orcs wind up serving as enforcers for thieves guilds or other types of organized crime. Less commonly, human cities may allow half-orcs a more normal existence, even enabling them to develop small communities of their own. These communities are usually centered around the arena districts, the military, or mercenary organizations where their brute strength is valued, and their appearance is more likely to be overlooked. Even surrounded by their own kind, half-orc life isn't easy. Bullying and physical confrontation comes easy to a people who have been raised with few other examples of behavior. It is, however, one of the best places for young half-orcs to grow up without prejudice, and these small enclaves are one of the few places where half-orc marriages and children are truly accepted and sometimes cherished.\n"
"Even more rarely, certain human cultures come to embrace half-orcs for their strength. There are stories of places where people see half-orc children as a blessing and seek out half-orc or orc lovers. In these cultures, half-orcs lead lives not much different from full-blooded humans.\n"
"<b>Relations:</b>\n"
"<link=\"Encyclopedia:Elves\"><b>Elves</b></link> and <link=\"Encyclopedia:Dwarves\"><b>dwarves</b></link> tend to be the least accepting of half-orcs, seeing in them too great a resemblance to their racial enemies, and other races aren't much more understanding. A lifetime of persecution leaves the average half-orc wary and quick to anger, yet people who break through his savage exterior might find a well-hidden core of empathy. <link=\"Encyclopedia:Humans\"><b>Human</b></link> societies with few orc problems tend to be the most accommodating, and half-orcs dwelling there can often find work as mercenaries and enforcers. Even in places where there is a general tolerance for half-orcs, however, many humans mistreat them when they can get away with it.\n"
"Half-orcs are envious of the measure of acceptance <link=\"Encyclopedia:Half-elves\"><b>half-elves</b></link> have within human and elven society and resent their physical beauty, which contrasts starkly to the half-orcs' brutish appearance. While half-orcs avoid antagonizing their half-breed cousins directly, they won't hesitate to undermine them if the opportunity presents itself.\n"
"Of all the other races, half-orcs are most sympathetic with <link=\"Encyclopedia:Halflings\"><b>halflings</b></link>, who often have an equally rough lot in life. Half-orcs respect the halfling's ability to blend in and disappear and admire their perpetually cheerful outlook on life despite hardships. Halflings fail to appreciate this fact because they usually are too busy avoiding the large, intimidating half-orcs.\n"
"<b>Alignment and Religion:</b>\n"
"Forced to live either among brutish orcs or as lonely outcasts in civilized lands, most half-orcs are bitter, violent, and reclusive. Evil comes easily to them, but they are not evil by nature — rather, most half-orcs are chaotic neutral, having been taught by long experience that there's no point doing anything but that which directly benefits themselves. Half-orcs worship the human or orc gods venerated in the area where they were raised. Those who live alongside humans most often worship human gods of war, freedom, or destruction. Half-orcs raised in orc tribes find themselves most drawn to the gods of blood, fire, and iron — depending more on what god the tribe worships rather than the half-orcs' personal preference. Many half-orcs are contrary about religion, either ignoring it entirely, or getting deeply involved in it and trying to find meaning in a life filled with hate and misunderstanding; even a half-orc divine spellcaster may wrestle with doubt and anger about religion and faith.\n"
"<b>Adventurers:</b>\n"
"Staunchly independent, many half-orcs take to lives of adventure out of necessity, seeking to escape their painful pasts or improve their lot through force of arms. Others, more optimistic or desperate for acceptance, take up the mantle of crusaders in order to prove their worth to the world. Half-orcs raised in orc societies often take up the brutish ways of those around them, becoming fighters, barbarians, or rangers. Half-orcs who survive their shaman training may eventually succeed their masters as tribal shamans, or flee the tribe and practice their magic as outcasts or explorers.\n"
"Half-orcs are just as likely to have children that possess an innate talent for sorcery as any other race, with the abyssal, destined, and elemental (fire) bloodlines being the most common types of sorcerers. Half-orcs are fascinated by alchemy, and its destructive capabilities make its usefulness obvious in any orc tribe. Half-orc alchemists treat themselves as living experiments, even to the point of trying to separate their orc and human halves through alchemy. Other alchemists use their powers to enhance their physical abilities and thus increase their status within orc communities.\n"
"In human societies, half-orcs have a few more options. Many find it easy to take advantage of the brute strength and work as mercenaries or caravan guards. Crime is another easy route for half-orcs, as there are plenty of criminals looking for a strong arm. Half-orc clerics in human communities are fairly rare; the more religious half-orcs more often turn to (or get pushed to) the martial aspects of religious service and become paladins or inquisitors. Half-orcs usually lack the patience and money required to become a wizard.\n"

"<b>Physical Description:</b>\n"
"Halflings rise to a humble height of 3 feet. They prefer to walk barefoot, leading the bottoms of their feet to become roughly calloused. Tufts of thick, curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet.\n"
"Their skin tends toward a rich cinnamon color and their hair toward light shades of brown. A halfling's ears are pointed, but proportionately not much larger than those of a human.\n"
"Halflings prefer simple and modest clothing. Though willing and able to dress up if the situation demands it, their racial urge to remain quietly in the background makes them rather conservative dressers in most situations. Halfling entertainers, on the other hand, make their livings by drawing attention, and tend to go overboard with gaudy and flashy costumes.\n"
"<b>Society:</b>\n"
"Rather than place their faith in empires or great causes, many halflings prefer to focus on the simpler and humbler virtues of their families and local communities. Halflings claim no cultural homeland and control no settlements larger than rural assemblies of free towns. Most often, they dwell at the knees of their human cousins in human cities, eking out livings as they can from the scraps of larger societies. Many halflings lead perfectly fulfilling lives in the shadow of their larger neighbors, while some prefer more nomadic lives, traveling the world and experiencing all it has to offer.\n"
"Halflings rely on customs and traditions to maintain their own culture. They have an extensive oral history filled with important stories about folk heroes who exemplify particular halfling virtues, but otherwise see little purpose in studying history in and of itself. Given a choice between a pointless truth and a useful fable, halflings almost always opt for the fable. This tendency helps to explain at least something of the famous halfling adaptability. Halflings look to the future and find it very easy to cast off the weight of ancient grudges or obligations that drag down so many other races.\n"
"<b>Relations:</b>\n"
"A typical halfling prides himself on his ability to go unnoticed by other races — a trait that allows many halflings to excel at thievery and trickery. Most halflings know full well the stereotypical view other races take of them as a result, and go out of their way to be forthcoming and friendly to the bigger races when they're not trying to go unnoticed. They get along fairly well with <link=\"Encyclopedia:Gnomes\"><b>gnomes</b></link>, although most halflings regard these eccentric creatures with a hefty dose of caution. Halflings respect <link=\"Encyclopedia:Elves\"><b>elves</b></link> and <link=\"Encyclopedia:Dwarves\"><b>dwarves</b></link>, but these races often live in remote regions far from the comforts of civilization that halflings enjoy, thus limiting opportunities for interaction. By and large, only <link=\"Encyclopedia:Half-orcs\"><b>half-orcs</b></link> are shunned by halflings, for their great size and violent natures are a bit too intimidating for most halflings to cope with. Halflings coexist well with <link=\"Encyclopedia:Humans\"><b>humans</b></link> as a general rule, but since some of the more aggressive human societies value halflings as slaves, they try not to grow too complacent. Halflings strongly value their freedom, especially the ability to travel in search of new experiences and the autonomy this requires. However, practical and flexible as always, enslaved halflings seldom fight back directly against their masters. When possible, they wait for the perfect opportunity and then simply slip away. Sometimes, if enslaved for long enough, halflings even come to adopt their owners as their new families. Though they still dream of escape and liberty, these halflings also make the best of their lives.\n"
"<b>Alignment and Religion:</b>\n"
"Halflings are loyal to their friends and families, but since they dwell in a world dominated by races twice as large as themselves, they have come to grips with the fact that sometimes they need to scrape and scrounge for survival. Most halflings are neutral as a result. Though they usually make a show of respecting the laws and endorsing the prejudices of their communities, halflings place an even greater emphasis on the innate common sense of the individual. When a halfling disagrees with society at large, he will do what he thinks is best. Always practical, halflings frequently worship the deity most favored by their larger and more powerful neighbors. They also usually cover their bets, however. The goddess of both luck and travel seems a natural fit for most halflings and offering her a quick prayer every now and then is only common sense.\n"
"<b>Adventurers:</b>\n"
"Their inherent luck coupled with their insatiable wanderlust makes halflings ideal candidates for lives of adventure. Though perfectly willing to pocket any valuables they come across, halflings often care more for the new experiences adventuring brings them than for any material reward. Halflings tend to view money as a means of making their lives easier and more comfortable, not as an end in and of itself. Other such vagabonds often put up with this curious race in hopes that some of their mystical luck will rub off. Halflings see nothing wrong with encouraging this belief, not just in their traveling companions, but also in the larger world. Many try to use their reputation for luck to haggle for reduced fare when traveling by ship or caravan, or even for an overnight stay at an inn. They meet with mixed success, but there are just enough stories circulating about the good fortune that befalls people traveling with halflings to give even the most skeptical pause. Of course, some suspect that halflings deliberately spread these reports for just that reason.\n"

"A hamadryad is the queen of her forest and the leader of all the dryads within it. Much as a dryad is bonded with one tree and is devoted to it, a hamadryad loves her chosen forest; while she does not sicken and die if separated from it, she loathes such separation. All nonevil woodland creatures acknowledge her as the wisest of dryads and respect her gifts of healing and diplomacy. In most forests, a hamadryad is the sister or wife of an erlking, and represents the protective, patient, and nurturing aspect of nature. With her healing magic, she can relieve the suffering of a dryad whose tree has been killed and sustain her long enough for her to bond with another tree.\n"
"A hamadryad prefers to avoid direct confrontations, instead using her magic and allies to divert, confuse, and even befriend any would-be enemies. Her powers allow her to speak with or quickly travel to her subjects even when they are in the most remote parts of the forest. As a consequence, little happens in the forest without her knowledge, and those who enter her realm would do well to remember this."

"Skin color among hill giants ranges from light tan to deep, ruddy brown. Their hair is brown or black, with eyes the same color. Hill giants wear layers of crudely prepared hides with the fur left on. They seldom wash or repair their garments, preferring simply to add more hides as their old ones wear out. Adults are around 10 feet tall and weigh about 1,100 pounds. Hill giants can live to be 200 years old, but almost never do.\n"
"Hill giants prefer to fight from high, rocky outcroppings, where they can pelt opponents with rocks and boulders while limiting the risk to themselves. Hill giants love to make overrun attacks against smaller creatures when they first join battle. Thereafter, they stand fast and swing away with their massive clubs.\n"
"Hill giants are the most nomadic of all the humanoid giant species, preferring to travel from one settlement to the next in order to raid and pillage. While they prefer temperate climates, they'll travel far from their preferred environment so long as the raiding is plentiful and successful. They are, as a whole, incredibly selfish creatures and rarely engage in battles they don't automatically know they'll win. Hill giants are known for shoving one another at terrifying foes and won't hesitate to sacrifice a clanmate to save their own skins. Roving bands of hill giants are common in temperate hills, and their constant aggression makes them one of the more feared dangers in this climate.\n"
"Solitary, non-evil hill giants are very rare but can sometimes be found in other humanoid societies, though they are almost never accepted in central cities or population centers. They do best as laborers and soldiers in outlying frontier towns, and often serve as rudimentary diplomats to negotiate with marauding hill giant bands. Unfortunately, hill giants who shed their racial lifestyle for civilization are mocked and often killed on sight by their nomadic brethren. Still, these \"civilized\" hill giants can find their place within society and many have managed to live peaceful, uneventful lives."

"As stout as a bull with a reptile's scaly, spiked body, hodags are legendary forest predators that hunt along the edges of civilization in thick woods. Green, gray, and black scales cover the beasts, helping them blend in amid underbrush, and sharp spikes stand along their backs and run down their powerful, dangerous tails. Loggers share stories of being followed by hodags and seeing their glowing red eyes in the otherwise oppressive darkness of the deep forest.

"<b>Physical Description:</b>\n"
"The physical characteristics of humans are as varied as the world's climes. From the dark-skinned tribesmen of the southern continents to the pale and barbaric raiders of the northern lands, humans possess a wide variety of skin colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, humans' skin color assumes a darker hue the closer to the equator they live. At the same time, bone structure, hair color and texture, eye color, and a host of facial and bodily phenotypic characteristics vary immensely from one locale to another. Cheekbones may be high or broad, noses aquiline or flat, and lips full or thin; eyes range wildly in hue, some deep set in their sockets, and others with full epicanthic folds. Appearance is hardly random, of course, and familial, tribal, or national commonalities often allow the knowledgeable to identify a human's place of origin on sight, or at least to hazard a good guess. Humans' origins are also indicated through their traditional styles of bodily decoration, not only in the clothing or jewelry worn, but also in elaborate hairstyles, piercing, tattooing, and even scarification.\n"
"<b>Society:</b>\n"
"Human society comprises a multitude of governments, attitudes, and lifestyles. Though the oldest human cultures trace their histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of common races like elves and dwarves, human society seems to be in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old. In general, humans are known for their flexibility, ingenuity, and ambition.\n"
"<b>Relations:</b>\n"
"Humans are fecund, and their drive and numbers often spur them into contact with other races during bouts of territorial expansion and colonization. In many cases, this leads to violence and war, yet humans are also swift to forgive and forge alliances with races who do not try to match or exceed them in violence. Proud, sometimes to the point of arrogance, humans might look upon dwarves as miserly drunkards, elves as flighty fops, halflings as craven thieves, gnomes as twisted maniacs, and half-elves and half-orcs as embarrassments—but the race's diversity among its own\n"
"members also makes humans quite adept at accepting others for what they are.\n"
"<b>Alignment and Religion:</b> Humanity is perhaps the most diverse of all the common races, with a capacity for both great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast barbaric hordes, while others build sprawling cities that cover miles. Taken as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they generally tend to congregate in nations and civilizations with specific alignments. Humans also have the widest range of gods and religions, lacking other races' ties to tradition and eager to turn to anyone offering them glory or protection.\n"

"The legendary hydra is a beast of vicious hunger and amazing regenerative powers, renowned for its ability to sprout two new heads when one is decapitated. Resembling a collection of snapping serpents atop a thick, coiling lower body that can run up to 20 feet long, the Hydra is an imposing and brutish menace, lairing in the clammy backwaters of the world and devouring any creature smaller than itself. Its scales are as varied in hue as those of any species of snake, from glossy to dull and from greenish black to crimson, often marked with patterns of stripes, diamonds, and patchworks of color. Some hydras have heads that are more fanged and viperlike, with smooth and supple scales, while others have rugged hides that are leathery in texture, and elongated crocodilian or even draconic visages. Regardless, most hydras possess brightly colored frills or crests, traits they take great pride in and use to intimidate prey as well as to scare off potential predators.\n"
"The hydra is not a creature to be trifled with. The only thing worse than meeting one by chance is attempting to turn the tables and actively hunt the hydra. While too dim to understand the human thirst for revenge, a hydra is all too willing to welcome a foolhardy hunter into its coils, adding its prey's remains to its own stock of grisly trophies hung from the branches around its swampy home. It is only the blessing of the gods that such a terror is not made worse with a sharper mind."

"Grim and determined, the inquisitor roots out enemies of the faith, using trickery and guile when righteousness and purity is not enough. Although inquisitors are dedicated to a deity, they are above many of the normal rules and conventions of the church. They answer to their deity and their own sense of justice alone, and are willing to take extreme measures to meet their goals.\n"
"<b>Role</b>: Inquisitors tend to move from place to place, chasing down enemies and researching emerging threats. As a result, they often travel with others, if for no other reason than to mask their presence. Inquisitors work with members of their faith whenever possible, but even such allies are not above suspicion.\n"
"<b><link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\">Alignment</link>:</b> An inquisitor's alignment must be within one step of her deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis.\n"
"<b>Hit Dice:</b> d8\n"
"<b>Skill Ranks per Level</b>: 3 + Int modifier\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Inquisitor Proficiencies</b>\n"
"An inquisitor is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longbow, shortbow, and the favored weapon of her deity. She is also proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).\n"
"<b>Deity Selection</b>\n"
"A deity, also known as a god or goddess, is a being or force of incredible power capable of granting its power to mortal beings through divine magic. A deity is strongly associated with a specific alignment, several domains, and a plane (typically an Outer Sphere plane).\n"
"<b>Orisons</b>\n"
"Inquisitors can cast a number of Orisons, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.\n"
"<b>Stern Gaze</b>\n"
"Inquisitors are skilled at sensing deception and intimidating their foes. An inquisitor receives a morale bonus on all Persuasion checks made to intimidate, and Perception checks equal to 1/2 her inquisitor level (minimum +1).\n"
"<b>Domain Selection</b>\n"
"A cleric's or inquisitor's deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her alignment matches that domain.\n"
"Each domain grants a number of domain powers, dependent upon the level of the cleric or the inquisitor.\n"
"Clerics as well gain a number of bonus spells. A cleric gains one domain spell slot for each level of cleric spell she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a cleric can prepare one of the spells from her two domains in that slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in her domain spell slot. Domain spells cannot be used to cast spells spontaneously.\n"
"<b>Judgment</b>\n"
"Starting at 1st level, an inquisitor can pronounce judgment upon her foes as a swift action. Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.\n"
"At 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end.\n"
"When the inquisitor uses this ability, she must select one type of judgment to make. As a swift action, she can change this judgment to another type.\n"
"<b>Cunning Initiative</b>\n"
"At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her <link=\"Encyclopedia:Wisdom\"><b>Wisdom</b></link> modifier on initiative checks, in addition to her <link=\"Encyclopedia:Dexterity\"><b>Dexterity</b></link> modifier.\n"
"<b>Solo Tactics</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, all of the inquisitor's allies are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feats as the inquisitor for the purpose of determining whether the inquisitor receives a bonus from her teamwork feats. Her allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually possess the feats themselves. The allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the inquisitor to receive the listed bonus.\n"
"<b>Teamwork Feat</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as teamwork feats. The inquisitor must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.\n"
"<b>Bane</b>\n"
"At 5th level, an inquisitor can imbue one of her weapons with the bane weapon special ability as a swift action.\n"
"A bane weapon excels against certain foes. Against a designated foe, the weapon's enhancement bonus is +2 better than its actual bonus. It also deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against such foes.\n"
"This ability only functions while the inquisitor wields the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon resumes granting this ability if it is returned to the inquisitor before the duration expires.\n"
"This ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the inquisitor's level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.\n"
"<b>Second Judgment</b>\n"
"At 8th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she selects two different judgments, instead of one. This only consumes one use of her judgment ability. As a swift action, she can change one of these judgments to another type.\n"
"<b>Stalwart</b>\n"
"At 11th level, an inquisitor can use mental and physical resiliency to avoid certain attacks. If she makes a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, she instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can only be used if the inquisitor is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor.\n"
"<b>Third Judgment</b>\n"
"At 16th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she selects three different judgments, instead of just two. This only consumes one use of her judgment ability. As a swift action, the inquisitor can change one of these judgments to another type."

"At just over 900 years old, Iomedae is the youngest of the major deities of Golarion, and has only begun to reach her full potential as an independent deity in the last century. She is a righteous knight, fearless in fighting for her beliefs, and a missionary and crusader on behalf of the benign sovereignty of good and merciful justice for evil. She would rather convince evildoers to lay down their arms in honorable surrender than cut them down, but she will wield her mighty sword against those who persist in serving evil. She loathes incorrigible evil, fiend-spawn, traitors, and those who abuse good in the name of \"greater\" good. Now out from under the shadow of her patron, the slain human culture deity Aroden, she has proven she needs no mentor to guide her — she is valor, glory, honor, justice, and strength, and is unafraid to point her sword at the greatest evils facing the world.\n"
"Despite her youth and comparative late start, she has been instrumental in fighting evil in the world, even during her mortal lifetime as a paladin of Arazni (and, after that demigod's death, Aroden himself). Born a mortal in Cheliax, she led the Knights of Ozem in a series of victories over the Whispering Tyrant, and participated in his imprisonment. Success in the Test of the Starstone a short time later granted the valiant swordswoman a spark of divinity and brought her to the attention of Aroden, who elevated her to the position of his herald, vacated by the fallen Arazni. When the Last Azlanti died, Iomedae inherited most of his remaining followers. Though born in Cheliax, she is worshiped by many people outside that land, and most recently has taken up patronage of the Mendevian Crusades. Once the crusaders have succeeded in ending the expanding threat of the Worldwound, she plans to inspire them to wipe her homeland free of its diabolical taint.\n"
"Iomedae's avatar appears as a fierce Chelish swordswoman, resplendent in gleaming battle armor with heraldic markings, and brandishing a longsword and shield. When she is roused to battle, her white cloak turns red and her white-and-gold armor turns the silver-gray of adamantine. The light from her shield blinds all evil, the force of her aura causing the corrupt to weaken and collapse. She shows her approval of mortals by making mundane objects take on swordlike forms, bathing her chosen warriors in mysterious white or golden lights, and exerting a compass-like pull on longswords to guide her servants. Common folk pushed to defend themselves may happen upon an old, rusty blade that still has the strength of a new weapon and grows shinier the more it is used in the name of justice and honor. The Inheritor shows her displeasure by flickering lights, shattering weapons, and turning metal dull. In the rare cases where one of her paladins embraces evil, it is said that the traitor's cloak shifts to black and his shining metal armor and sword turn to dull lead.\n"
"As the major deity who was most recently mortal herself, the Inheritor has a strong empathic sense of human frailties and the costs of oppression. She ensures that her temples are havens for the weak and the overlooked, and many who initially come to her for refuge go on to become great warriors. Iomedae is both fiercely martial and adamantly feminine, and commands the respect of any deity who deals with her. She expects her mortal servants to exercise courtesy and receive the same in their dealings with one another.\n"
"The Inheritor's holy symbol is \"the sword of valor,\" a longsword surrounded by a burst of light, whether sunlight, fire, or some other energy. She is associated with lions, horses, eagles, griffons, and hippogriffs. The primary title she uses is the Inheritor, though the Knights of Ozem call her the Light of the Sword.\n"

"Irori was once a mortal man whose intense discipline allowed him to attain enlightenment and divinity through physical, mental, and spiritual perfection. He teaches that mastery of the self allows one to master the world, but paradoxically also purges one of desire to master the world. Countless others seek to follow his path, and he encourages them to challenge their minds, bodies, and souls in order to transcend their self-imposed limits. He is also a god of knowledge; his followers are keen students of history, for experience is key to understanding and there is much to be learned from the experiences of others.\n"
"Irori knows that there's no single technique that works for everyone, and that every student must experiment and practice to find the best method for her. He is patient, forgiving, and serene, welcoming all who seek perfection as brothers and sisters. He is a teacher who leads by example rather than issuing reprimands and corrections. Meanwhile, he constantly tests his own limits as a deity, expanding his awareness and control without impinging upon the interests of others. Originating from distant Vudra, Irori has gained a diverse following across the Inner Sea region as those who seek discipline and self-perfection look to him for inspiration.\n"
"Irori's followers rarely depict him in art because they believe that no icon can hope to live up to his perfect image. They describe him in poetry and prose as a flawless man, clothed in simple robes and wooden sandals, hairless save for a long braid. Beyond the Inner Sea region, his race often changes to reflect that of the artist; artists of the Inner Sea tend to depict him in ways that emphasize his exoticism. Irori sees no need to cloak himself in mystery or augment himself with divine power, so on the rare occasions when he manifests to mortals, he appears as a physically fit man matching his followers' descriptions, often sitting, kneeling patiently, or resting in a meditative pose. He's also been known to project a portion of his awareness into a statue, animating its face and speaking through it.\n"
"The Master of Masters teaches that body, mind, and spirit are inexorably linked, and that the division between them is illusory and counterproductive. Within each individual is a perfect version of these three aspects, called the Triune Self, and mastering all three while understanding that they are one is the key to achieving perfection and enlightenment. As most have difficulty sensing and refining their own spirits, novices usually prioritize improving the body and the mind, allowing the control gained from these efforts to steer the growth of the spirit.\n"
"Irori believes that self-awareness leads to discipline and eventually to mastery, whereas ignorance forces the spirit to repeat its mistakes in the next life. He opposes radical action and extreme changes in habits and behavior, preferring subtle shifts over time to allow a creature to adjust to unfamiliar practices and avoid adverse reactions to extreme change, such as injuries or emotional disorders. Discipline, moderation, and temperance lead to internal balance and are the keys to creating healthy, lasting change in a person's life; radical action without proper preparation is chaotic and leads to negative outcomes.\n"
"When Irori is pleased, he eases the path toward enlightenment — soothing pain, bestowing mental clarity, and granting insight about the next step in the worshiper's journey. Especially devout followers might catch a brief glimpse of the god's serene eyes, or come across the mysterious single imprint of a sandal in the sand. He sometimes punishes transgressions with cramps, fatigue, dizziness, and obvious setbacks on the path to self-perfection. However, in most cases he refrains from these actions, as he believes that for his sincere followers, straying from the ideal path is punishment enough, and that it's best for those who are not sincere to leave the church and pursue other interests. Only in extreme cases — generally with mortals who are destined for greatness — does he afflict the person with an injury or disability to overcome, either to encourage her to look for an alternate perspective to a problem, or to encourage humility in someone especially prideful.\n"
"Irori's holy symbol is an open blue palm within a circle.\n"

"The jabberwock is a true creature of legend — a subject of poetry, song, and myth in many cultures. It is known to be a devastating creature in combat whose arrival presages times of ruin and violence; these stories also tell of the creature's fear of the tools some say were created in ancient times for the sole purpose of defeating them — vorpal weapons. A jabberwock is 35 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds.\n"
"The jabberwock is not a creature of the Material Plane, but one from the primal world of the fey. It comes from a region of reality where life is more robust, where emotions are more potent, and where dreams and nightmares can come alive. Even in such incredible realms, though, the jabberwock is a creature to be feared. It belongs to a category of powerful creatures whose shapes and types run the gamut of possibility — a group known collectively as the \"Tane.\" Of the Tane, the jabberwock is said to be the most powerful, but the others in this grouping are far from helpless.\n"
"When a jabberwock comes to the Material Plane, it does so to spread destruction and ruin. Typically, the monster seeks out a remote forest lair at least a day's flight from civilization, then emerges from this den once a week to seek out a new place to destroy. It has no true interest in amassing treasure, but often gathers objects of obvious value to bring back to its den in order to encourage heroes to seek it out—to a jabberwock, it makes no difference whether it seeks out things to destroy or lets those things come to it.\n"
"Jabberwocks age, eat, drink, and sleep like any living creature, but they do not reproduce in the classic sense of the word. The creation of a new jabberwock — or of any of the Tane, in fact — is regulated by the strange and unknowable godlike entities that dwell in the primeval world. These fey lords create new jabberwocks as they are needed — sometimes varying the exact particulars, but always creating a fully formed adult creature.\n"
"No young jabberwock has ever been encountered as a result. The strange vulnerability a jabberwock possesses against vorpal weapons has long been a matter of intrigue and speculation among scholars. Most believe that, once upon a time, only one jabberwock existed, a creature of such great power that nothing could hurt it. Nothing, that is, save for a legendary sword forged for a mortal hero by a now-forgotten artisan or god. So epic was this battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of the vorpal swords and jabberwocks known today, can be found on many worlds."

It grants either a +4 armor bonus to AC or a +2 shield bonus to AC, and you can change the type of bonus as a standard action. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, You can increase the bonus by 1 until the next time your burn is removed. You can increase the bonus multiple times in this way, but it can't be increased by more than 50% of its starting value.\n"

"You can use this form infusion once as part of an attack action, a charge action, or a full-attack action in order to make melee attacks with your kinetic blade. Since it's part of another action (and isn't an action itself), using this wild talent doesn't provoke any additional attacks of opportunity. The kinetic blade deals your kinetic blast damage on each hit (applying any modifiers to your kinetic blast's damage as normal, but not your Strength modifier). The blade disappears at the end of your turn. The weapon deals the same damage type that your kinetic blast deals, and it interacts with Armor Class and spell resistance as normal for a blast of its type.

"Kineticists are living channels for elemental matter and energy, manipulating the world around them by drawing upon inner reserves from their own bodies. Kineticists often awaken to their kinetic abilities during a violent or traumatic experience, releasing their power involuntarily. As kinetic power is seldom inherited, kineticists are rarely able to find mentors to guide them, so they must delve into these mysteries on their own to learn to control their gifts.\n"
"<b>Role:</b> Kineticists generally use their powers to assail their foes from range, but based on the way their talents develop, they can channel their kinetic abilities for a variety of situations. Kineticists are usually quite different from their families and friends, so they often strike out on their own or alongside others with extraordinary talents.\n"
"<b><link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\">Alignment</link>:</b> Any\n"
"<b>Hit Die:</b> d8\n"
"<b>Skill Ranks Per Level:</b> 4 + Int modifier\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Kineticist Proficiencies</b>\n"
"Kineticists are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor, but not shields.\n"
"<b>Elemental Focus</b>\n"
"At 1st level, a kineticist chooses one primary element on which to focus. This element determines how she accesses the raw power of the Ethereal Plane, and grants her access to specific wild talents and additional class skills. She gains her selected element's basic utility wild talent (basic aerokinesis, etc.) as a bonus wild talent.\n"
"<b>Wild Talents</b>\n"
"A kineticist can use wild talents — magical abilities similar to spells but drawn from the kineticist's innate psychic talent and usable at will. Wild talents are typically spell-like abilities (though some are supernatural abilities), and take a standard action to use unless otherwise noted. Every wild talent has an effective spell level. A kineticist can always select 1st-level wild talents, but she can select a wild talent of a higher level only if her kineticist level is at least double the wild talent's effective spell level. Kinetic blast and defense wild talents are always considered to have an effective spell level equal to 1/2 the kineticist's class level (to a maximum effective spell level of 9th at kineticist level 18th). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for a saving throw against a wild talent is equal to 10 + the wild talent's effective spell level + the kineticist's Constitution modifier. The kineticist uses her Constitution modifier on all concentration checks for wild talents. In addition to the wild talents she gains from her other class features, at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a kineticist selects a new utility wild talent from the list of options available to her. A kineticist can select only universal wild talents or those that match her element.\n"
"<b>Burn</b>\n"
"At 1st level, a kineticist can overexert herself to channel more power than normal, pushing past the limit of what is safe for her body by accepting burn. Some of her wild talents allow her to accept burn in exchange for a greater effect, while others require her to accept a certain amount of burn to use that talent at all. For each point of burn she accepts, a kineticist takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per character level. This damage can't be healed by any means other than getting a full night's rest, which removes all burn and associated nonlethal damage. Nonlethal damage from burn can't be reduced or redirected, and a kineticist incapable of taking nonlethal damage can't accept burn. A kineticist can accept only 1 point of burn per round. This limit rises to 2 points of burn at 6th level, and rises by 1 additional point every 3 levels thereafter. A kineticist can't choose to accept burn if it would put her total number of points of burn higher than 3 + her Constitution modifier (though she can be forced to accept more burn from a source outside her control). A kineticist who has accepted burn never benefits from abilities that allow her to ignore or alter the effects she receives from nonlethal damage.\n"
"<b>Kinetic Blast</b>\n"
"At 1st level, a kineticist gains a kinetic blast wild talent of her choice. This kinetic blast must be a simple blast that matches her element.\n"
"As a standard action, the kineticist can unleash a kinetic blast at a single target in close range. She must have at least one hand free to aim the blast. All damage from a kinetic blast is treated as magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Kinetic blasts count as a type of weapon for the purpose of feats such as Weapon Focus. The kineticist is never considered to be wielding or gripping the kinetic blast, and she can't use Vital Strike feats with kinetic blasts. Even the weakest kinetic blast involves a sizable mass of elemental matter or energy, so kinetic blasts always deal full damage to swarms of any size (though only area blasts deal extra damage to swarms).\n"
"Each simple blast is either a physical blast or an energy blast.\n"
"Physical blasts are ranged attacks that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6+1 + the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 1d6+1 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st. Spell resistance doesn't apply against physical blasts.\n"
"Energy blasts are ranged touch attacks that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 1d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.\n"
"Composite blasts combine elements to form a new blast. When a kineticist gains a new element through expanded element, she gains access to all composite blasts for which she qualifies.\n"
"Most composite blasts are either physical or energy blasts, like simple blasts.\n"
"Physical composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6+2 + the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 2d6+2 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.\n"
"Energy composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6 + 1/2 the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 2d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.\n"
"<b>Gather Power</b>\n"
"If she has both hands free, a kineticist can gather energy or elemental matter as a move action. Gathering power in this way allows the kineticist to reduce the total burn cost of a blast wild talent she uses in the same round by 1 point. The kineticist can instead gather power for 1 full round in order to reduce the total burn cost of a blast wild talent used on her next turn by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points). If she does so, she can also gather power as a move action during her next turn to reduce the burn cost by a total of 3 points. This ability can never reduce the burn cost of a wild talent below 0 points.\n"
"<b>Infusion</b>\n"
"At 1st level, a kineticist gains an infusion wild talent from the list of options available based on her elemental focus. She gains additional infusions at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 17th, and 19th levels. By using infusions along with her kinetic blasts, a kineticist can alter her kinetic blasts to suit her needs. Infusions come in two types, each of which changes a kinetic blast differently: a substance infusion causes an additional effect, while a form infusion causes the kinetic blast to manifest in a different way. Each infusion can alter only certain kinds of kinetic blasts, which are listed in its Associated Blasts entry. Each time the kineticist uses one of her kinetic blast wild talents, she can apply up to one associated form infusion and up to one associated substance infusion.\n"
"Some infusions change the action required to activate a kinetic blast or entirely transform the kinetic blast's normal effects.\n"
"The burn cost listed in each infusion's Burn entry is added to the burn cost of the kinetic blast the infusion modifies.\n"
"The DC for a save against an infusion is based on the associated kinetic blast's effective spell level, not the level of the infusion. The DCs for form infusions are calculated using the kineticist's Dexterity modifier instead of her Constitution modifier. When a kineticist modifies a kinetic blast with a form infusion and a substance infusion that both require saving throws, each target first attempts a saving throw against the form infusion. If a target succeeds and a successful save negates the infusion's effects, the entire kinetic blast is negated; otherwise, the target then attempts a saving throw against the substance infusion. If a kineticist's form and substance infusions both alter the kinetic blast's damage, apply the substance infusion's alteration first.\n"
"<b>Elemental Defense</b>\n"
"At 2nd level, a kineticist gains her element's defensive wild talent.\n"
"She must select the expanded defense utility wild talent to gain the defensive wild talent of any element she gains via the expanded element class feature.\n"
"<b>Elemental Overflow</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, a kineticist's body surges with energy from her chosen element whenever she accepts burn. In addition, she receives a bonus on her attack rolls with kinetic blasts equal to the total number of points of burn she currently has, to a maximum bonus of +1 for every 3 kineticist levels she possesses. She also receives a bonus on damage rolls with her kinetic blast equal to double the bonus on attack rolls.\n"
"As a kineticist's body becomes more and more suffused with her element, she begins to gain more powerful benefits.\n"
"Starting at 6th level, whenever she has at least 3 points of burn, the kineticist gains a +2 size bonus to two physical ability scores of her choice. She also gains a chance to ignore the effects of a critical hit or sneak attack equal to 5% × her current number of points of burn. At 11th level, whenever the kineticist has at least 5 points of burn, these bonuses increase to a +4 size bonus to one physical ability score of her choice and a +2 size bonus to each of her other two physical ability scores.\n"
"At 16th level, whenever the kineticist has at least 7 points of burn, these bonuses increase to a +6 size bonus to one physical ability score of her choice, a +4 size bonus to a second physical ability score of her choice, and a +2 size bonus to the remaining physical ability score.\n"
"<b>Infusion Specialization</b>\n"
"At 5th level, whenever a kineticist uses one or more infusions with a blast, she reduces the combined burn cost of the infusions by 1. This can't reduce the total cost of the infusions used below 0.\n"
"She reduces the burn cost by 1 additional point at 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th levels.\n"
"<b>Metakinesis</b>\n"
"At 5th level, a kineticist gains the ability to alter her kinetic blasts as if with metamagic feats by accepting burn. By accepting 1 point of burn, she can empower her kinetic blast (as if using Empower Spell). At 9th level, by accepting 2 points of burn, she can maximize her kinetic blast as if using Maximize Spell. At 13th level, by accepting 3 points of burn, she can quicken her kinetic blast as if using Quicken Spell.\n"
"<b>Internal Buffer</b>\n"
"At 6th level, a kineticist's study of her body and the elemental forces that course through it allow her to form an internal buffer to store extra energy.\n"
"The buffer starts empty and doesn't replenish each day, but the kineticist can accept 1 point of burn to add 1 point to the buffer as a full-round action, to a maximum of 1 point total. This maximum increases to 2 points at 11th level and to 3 points at 16th level. Once the kineticist adds points to her buffer, they remain indefinitely until she spends them.\n"
"When she would otherwise accept burn, a kineticist can spend 1 point from her buffer to avoid accepting 1 point of burn. She cannot spend more than 1 point from her buffer in this way for a single wild talent. Points spent from the internal buffer don't activate elemental overflow or add to its effects. Similarly, this buffer can be used to exceed the limit on the number of points of burn the kineticist can accept in a single turn.\n"
"<b>Expanded Element</b>\n"
"At 7th level, a kineticist learns to use another element or expands her understanding of her own element. She can choose any element, including her primary element. She gains one of that element's simple blast wild talents that she does not already possess, if any. She also gains all composite blast wild talents whose prerequisites she meets. She doesn't gain the defensive wild talent of the expanded element unless she later selects it with the expanded defense utility wild talent.\n"
"At 15th level, the kineticist can either select a new element or expand her understanding of her original element. She can't select the same element she selected at 7th level. She gains all the benefits from her new expanded element as listed above.\n"
"<b>Supercharge</b>\n"
"At 11th level, when using gather power as a move action, a kineticist can reduce the total burn cost of a single wild talent by 2 points instead of 1. When using gather power for 1 full round, she can reduce the burn cost of a single wild talent by 3 points instead of 2.\n"
"<b>Composite Specialization</b>\n"
"At 16th level, a kineticist becomes more adept at creating composite blasts. She reduces the burn cost of all composite blasts by 1 point.\n"
"This can't reduce the cost of a composite blast below 0 points.\n"
"<b>Metakinetic Master</b>\n"
"At 19th level, a kineticist chooses one type of metakinesis, such as empower or quicken. She reduces the burn cost of that metakinesis by 1 point (to a minimum of 0 points)."

"Gnolls claim that when Lamashtu first saw the hyena, she took it as her consort and the first gnoll was born. A thousand such stories abound about all manner of creatures, each citing the Mother of Monsters as the beasts' progenitor. Lamashtu's worshipers seek out deformity both in themselves and others. Scarring rituals and mutilation are common among the faithful. Although typically venerated by monstrous races, such as gnolls, medusas, and goblins, some human cults practice her dark litanies in secret, promoting tainted births and destroying works of beauty. Some use magic to become more hideous or beastlike in appearance, while her monstrous followers do the opposite to spy on citydwellers. Lamashtu's crude depictions usually paint her as a jackal-headed woman, with long feathered wings, taloned feet, and a great swollen belly. Such images frequently include a multitude of monsters gathering to her call, with the favored rising above the rest.\n"
"Ritual garb includes a jackal mask made of leather or precious metal, a cloak of black feathers, and a pair of swords or knives decorated to resemble the Demon Queen's own weapons. Places of worship are often as simple as a flat rock but might include a ring of stones, pillars, trees, or wooden blocks; some might have a deep hole in the ground or access to some sort of chasm representing an entrance to the goddess's underworld realm. Her holy \"text\" is the Skull of Mashag, a magical skull that recites the goddess' doctrine.\n"
"Lamashtu is one of countless demon lords — quite possibly the most powerful of demon lords. One of her monikers reflects this level of power — the Demon Queen. Yet Lamashtu does not seek to rule the Abyss or bend the other demon lords to her will. She maintains wars with some (such as her archnemesis Pazuzu) and is rumored to be the lover of others (decadant Socothbenoth often brags of the children he has sired with her), yet her true interests lie beyond the petty squabbles of the demon host.\n"
"Lamashtu's favor appears as violent dreams, the appearance of sudden deformities, or unexplained pregnancies resulting in the painful (often fatal) birth of a deformed child.\n"

"Treacherous primeval dragons of the northern regions of the world, linnorms thrive on their hatred for those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inflict as much suffering as possible unto their unfortunate victims. Sweeping bones and treasures alike into giant piles in its lair, the typical linnorm has a barbaric nature made all the worse by its insatiable greed and atrocious gluttony. Few creatures are as bold and as cruel as linnorms, and for that most people are thankful.\n"
"Linnorms are not true dragons, but they nonetheless possess incredible strength and deadly powers that often rival authentic dragon brutality. Their massive frames make crushing smaller enemies a simple task, and of those who have felt the sting of a linnorm's venomous bite, few have survived the devastating poison long enough to tell the tale. A linnorm's body is serpentine and lacks wings, yet these dragons fly through the air with supernatural ease, accomplishing the feat as easily as a fish through water.\n"
"Beyond the physical might, venom, and devastating breath weapons typical of all linnorms, the beasts all share a potent final defense — the death curse. This powerful plaguing of the mind manifests itself in myriad forms, but always serves as a horrid vengeance against any who might manage to slay a linnorm. Some theorize that the curse is a sending from malevolent gods who watch over linnorms and view them as destruction loving pets. Others believe the linnorms' curse is the closest remaining connection they have to the primeval world of the fey, from whence the first of these monsters is said to have come. Whatever the case may be, its curse makes killing a linnorm as dangerous as letting it live.\n"
"True dragons of higher intellect often hold linnorms in great scorn, viewing the beings as prematurely evolved beasts and refusing to even acknowledge the creatures as related to them. Linnorms have few feelings regarding the matter, battling younger and older dragons alike just as readily as any other creatures who dare to step foot in their territories. Their simplemindedness stifles any ability to assemble mass sieges or even cooperate in small groups, so linnorms almost always function alone, individually hunting over large territories in order to waylay as many travelers as possible. Linnorms only seek a mate once during their long lifetimes, the female producing several clutches of up to six eggs as a result. Of these eggs, only one will survive — the first to hatch immediately feasts on its unhatched brethren.\n"
"Despite their lust for devastation, linnorms usually live in relatively remote areas, never straying far from the northernmost reaches of the world. As they are universally hated and feared by most other intelligent creatures, their tendency to dwell in more isolated regions helps ensure their survival; while linnorms are vicious and unforgiving, their lack of organization makes them highly susceptible to raiding parties seeking to eradicate their presence, though such parties would need to be made up of truly impressive individuals. More often than not, a linnorm resides totally undisturbed in the spot it chooses as its own for hundreds of years, stewing in its own malevolence until finally snapping and going on a rampage. Sometimes, villages aren't even aware of a slumbering linnorm's proximity, but usually such settlements have long traditions and local legends revolving around \"their linnorm.\" Since a linnorm can hibernate for centuries, villages composed of shorterlived humanoids might consider these tales as little more than quaint stories, but when the linnorm wakes, the truth becomes impossible to doubt.\n"
"Linnorms come in many different varieties, but all share the qualities of being horribly strong and bestial. They feast solely on meat, usually eating goats and other mountain animals when more intelligent creatures such as humanoids don't readily present themselves. Linnorms are prone to gorging and then falling into a deep sleep near their treasure hordes, waking either when they become aware of intruders in their vicinity or to feed once more."

"Lizardfolk are proud and powerful reptilian predators that make their communal homes in scattered villages deep within swamps and marshes. Uninterested in colonization of the dry lands and content with the simple weapons and rituals that have served them well for millennia, lizardfolk are viewed by many other races as backwater savages, but within their isolated communities lizardfolk are actually a vibrant people filled with tradition and an oral history stretching back to before humans walked upright.\n"
"Most lizardfolk stand 6 to 7 feet tall and weigh 200 to 250 pounds, their powerful muscles covered in scales of gray, green, or brown. Some breeds have short dorsal spikes or brightly colored frills, and all swim well by moving with flicks of their powerful 4-foot-long tails. While completely at home in the water, they breathe air and return to their clustered mound-dwellings to breed and sleep. As their reptilian blood makes them sluggish in the cold, most lizardfolk hunt and work during the day and retreat to their homes at night to curl up with other tribesmen in the shared warmth of large peat fires.\n"
"Though generally neutral, lizardfolks' standoffish demeanor, staunch rejection of civilization's \"gifts,\" and legendary ferocity in battle cause them to be viewed negatively by most humanoids. These traits stem from good reasons, however, as their own slow rate of reproduction is no match for warm-blooded humanoids, and those tribes who don't defend their wetland territories to the last breath quickly find themselves overwhelmed by the mammalian hordes. As for their tendency to consume the bodies of dead friends and enemies alike, the practical lizardfolk are quick to point out that life is hard in the swamp, and nothing should go to waste.\n"
"The lizardfolk presented here dwell in a swampy environment. Lizardfolk tribes can exist in other environments as well, but they lose their swim speed and instead gain a climb speed of 15 feet."

"There are those who spend their lives poring over ancient tomes and texts, unlocking the power of magic, and there are those who spend their time perfecting the use of individual weapons, becoming masters without equal. The magus is at once a student of both philosophies, blending magical ability and martial prowess into something entirely unique, a discipline in which both spell and steel are used to devastating effect. As he grows in power, the magus unlocks powerful forms of arcana that allow him to merge his talents further, and at the pinnacle of his art, the magus becomes a blur of steel and magic, a force that few foes would dare to stand against.\n"
"<b>Role</b>: Magi spend much of their time traveling the world, learning whatever martial or arcane secrets they can find. They might spend months learning a new sword-fighting style from a master warrior, while simultaneously moonlighting in the local library, poring through tomes of ancient lore. Most who take this path dabble in all sorts of lore, picking up anything that might aid them in their search for perfection.\n"
"<b><link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\">Alignment</link>:</b> Any\n"
"<b>Hit Die:</b> d8\n"
"<b>Skill Ranks per Level:</b> 1 + Int modifier\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Magus Proficiencies</b>\n"
"A magus is proficient with all simple and martial weapons. A magus is also proficient with light armor. He can cast magus spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass magus still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.\n"
"<b>Arcane Pool</b>\n"
"At 1st level, the magus gains a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that he can draw upon to fuel his powers and enhance his weapon. This arcane pool has a number of points equal to 1/2 his magus level (minimum 1) + his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Intelligence\"><b>Intelligence</b></link> modifier. The pool refreshes once per day when the magus prepares his spells.\n"
"At 1st level, a magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding a +1 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.\n"
"At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst or speed.\n"
"Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the magus uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the magus.\n"
"A magus can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.\n"
"<b>Cantrips</b>\n"
"Magi can cast a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.\n"
"<b>Spell Combat</b>\n"
"At 1st level, a magus learns to cast spells and wield his weapons at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, the magus must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic components), while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, he can make all of his attacks with his melee weapon at a –2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty).\n"
"<b>Spell Strike</b>\n"
"At 2nd level, whenever a magus casts a spell with a range of \"touch\" from the magus spell list, he can deliver the spell through any weapon he is wielding as part of a melee attack.\n"
"Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, a magus can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If the magus makes this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks.\n"
"This attack uses the weapon's critical range (20, 19–20, or 18–20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals ×2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.\n"
"<b>Magus Arcana</b>\n"
"As he gains levels, a magus learns arcane secrets tailored to his specific way of blending martial puissance and magical skill. Starting at 3rd level, a magus gains one magus arcana. He gains an additional magus arcana for every three levels of magus attained after 3rd level. Unless specifically noted in a magus arcana's description, a magus cannot select a particular magus arcana more than once.\n"
"<b>Spell recall</b>\n"
"At 4th level, the magus learns to use his arcane pool to recall spells he has already cast. With a swift action he can recall any single magus spell that he has already prepared and cast that day by expending a number of points from his arcane pool equal to the spell's level (minimum 1). The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.\n"
"<b>Bonus Magus Feat</b>\n"
"At 5th level, and every six levels thereafter, a magus gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat or magic feats. He must meet the prerequisites for these feats as normal.\n"
"<b>Arcane Weapon (+2)</b>\n"
"At 1st level, a magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding a +1 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.\n"
"At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst or speed.\n"
"Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the magus uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the magus.\n"
"A magus can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.\n"
"<b>Arcane Medium Armor</b>\n"
"At 7th level, a magus gains proficiency with medium armor. A magus can cast magus spells while wearing medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus wearing heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component.\n"
"<b>Improved Spell Combat</b>\n"
"At 8th level, the magus's ability to cast spells and make melee attacks improves. When using the spell combat ability, the magus receives a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks.\n"
"<b>Fighter Training</b>\n"
"Starting at 10th level, a magus counts 1/2 his total magus level as his fighter level for the purpose of qualifying for feats. If he has levels in fighter, these levels stack.\n"
"<b>Improved Spell Recall</b>\n"
"At 11th level, the magus's ability to recall spells using his arcane pool becomes more efficient. Whenever he recalls a spell with spell recall, he expends a number of points from his arcane pool equal to 1/2 the spell's level (minimum 1).\n"
"<b>Arcane Heavy Armor</b>\n"
"At 13th level, a magus gains proficiency with heavy armor. A magus can cast magus spells while wearing heavy armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component.\n"
"<b>Greater Spell Combat</b>\n"
"At 14th level, the magus gains the ability to seamlessly cast spells and make melee attacks. Whenever he uses the spell combat ability, his concentration check bonus from Improved Spell Combat increases to +4.\n"
"<b>Counterstrike</b>\n"
"At 16th level, whenever an enemy within reach of the magus successfully casts a spell defensively, that enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from the magus after the spell is complete.\n"
"<b>Greater Spell Access</b>\n"
"At 19th level, the magus gains access to an expanded spell list. He learns and places 14 spells from the wizard's spell list into his spellbook as magus spells of their wizard level. He gains two of each of the following wizard spells not on the magus spell list:\n"
"0-level, 1st-level, 2nd-level, 3rd-level, 4th-level, 5th-level, and 6th-level.\n"
"He can ignore the somatic component of these spells, casting them without the normal chance of spell failure.\n"
"<b>True Magus</b>\n"
"At 20th level, the magus becomes a master of spells and combat. Whenever he uses his spell combat ability, he does not need to make a concentration check to cast the spell defensively.\n"
"Whenever the magus uses spell combat, he can choose to either increase the DC to resist his spells by +2, grant himself a +2 circumstance bonus on any checks made to overcome spell resistance, or grant himself a +2 circumstance bonus on all attack rolls.\n"
"<b>Selectable Features</b>\n"
"<b>Arcane Accuracy</b>\n"
"The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant himself an insight bonus equal to his Intelligence bonus on all attack rolls until the end of his turn.\n"
"<b>Bane Blade</b>\n"
"Whenever the magus enhances his weapon using his arcane pool, he may spend 1 additional point from his arcane pool to add the Bane special ability to the weapon.\n"
"<b>Devoted Blade</b>\n"
"Whenever the magus enhances his weapon using his arcane pool, he adds anarchic, axiomatic, holy, or unholy special abilities to the list of available options. A magus may only add one of these abilities if it matches his own alignment.\n"
"<b>Dimension Strike</b>\n"
"The magus can expend 2 points from his arcane pool as a swift action to resolve all of his melee weapon attacks until the end of his turn as melee touch attacks.\n"
"<b>Enduring Blade</b>\n"
"Magus increase the duration of an his Arcane Weapon ability by expending 1 additional point from his arcane pool every time he activates Arcane Weapon.\n"
"<b>Ghost Blade</b>\n"
"Whenever the magus enhances his weapon using his arcane pool, he adds Brilliant Energy and Ghost Touch special abilities to the list of available options. A magus may only add one of these abilities if it matches his own alignment.\n"
"<b>Hasted Assault</b>\n"
"The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to move more quickly. This functions as haste, but only targets the magus and lasts for a number of rounds equal to the magus's Intelligence bonus.\n"
"<b>Prescient Attack</b>\n"
"The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action, allowing him to anticipate his opponent's defenses. Enemies are denied their Dexterity bonus against the magus's attacks until the end of the magus's next turn.\n"
"<b>Wand Wielder</b>\n"
"The magus can activate a wand or staff in place of casting a spell when using spell combat.\n"
"<b>Wand Mastery</b>\n"
"Whenever the magus uses a wand, he calculates the DC for any spell it contains using his Intelligence modifier, instead of the minimum modifier needed to cast a spell of that level."

"Medusas are human-like creatures with snakes instead of hair. At distances of 30 feet or more, a medusa can easily pass for a beautiful woman if she wears something to cover her serpentine locks — when wearing clothing that conceals her head and face, she can be mistaken for a human at even closer distances. Medusas use lies and disguises that conceal their faces to get close enough to opponents to use their petrifying gaze, though they like playing with their prey and may fire arrows from a distance to lead enemies into traps. Some enjoy creating intricate decorations out of their victims, using their petrified remains as accents to their swampy lairs, but most medusas take care to hide the evidence of their previous conflicts so that new foes won't have advance warning of their presence.\n"
"Used to concealing themselves, medusas in cities are usually rogues, while those in the wilderness often pass themselves off as rangers or trackers. The most notorious and legendary medusas, though, are those who take levels as bards or clerics. Charismatic and intelligent, urban medusas are often involved with thieves' guilds or other aspects of the criminal underworld. Medusas may form alliances with blind creatures or intelligent undead, both of which are immune to their stony gaze. Spellcasting medusas often serve as oracles or prophets, usually dwelling in remote locations of legendary power or infamous history. Such oracle medusas take great delight in their roles, and if presented with the proper gifts and flattery, the secrets they offer can be quite helpful. Of course, the lairs of such potent creatures are liberally decorated with statues of those who have offended them, so the seeker of knowledge is well advised to tread carefully during such meetings.\n"
"All known medusas are female. Rarely, a medusa may decide to keep a male humanoid as a mate, usually with the help of elixirs of love or similar magic, and is always careful to not petrify her prisoner — at least until she grows tired of his company."

"For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the battlefield — it is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind. These warrior-artists search out methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves just as capable of crippling or killing as any blade. These monks (so called since they adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial disciplines) elevate their bodies to become weapons of war, from battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers. Monks tread the path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are meant to be.\n"
"<b>Role</b>: Monks excel at overcoming even the most daunting perils, striking where it's least expected, and taking advantage of enemy vulnerabilities. Fleet of foot and skilled in combat, monks can navigate any battlefield with ease, aiding allies wherever they are needed most.\n"
"<b><link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\">Alignment</link>:</b> Any lawful\n"
"<b>Hit Die:</b> d8\n"
"<b>Skill Ranks per Level:</b> 2 + Int modifier\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Monk Proficiencies</b>\n"
"Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.\n"
"Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.\n"
"When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.\n"
"<b>Flurry of Blows</b>\n"
"At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full attack. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what's already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).\n"
"At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.\n"
"<b>Unarmed Strike</b>\n"
"At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. The damage dealt by a <link=\"Encyclopedia:Size\"><b>Medium</b></link> monk's unarmed strike increases with level: 1d6 on levels 1-3, 1d8 on levels 4-7, 1d10 on levels 8-11, 2d6 on levels 12-15, 2d8 on levels 16-19, 2d10 on level 20.\n"
"If the monk is Small, his unarmed strike damage increases as follows: 1d4 on levels 1-3, 1d6 on levels 4-7, 1d8 on levels 8-11, 1d10 on levels 12-15, 2d6 on levels 16-19, 2d8 on level 20.\n"
"If the monk is Large, his unarmed strike damage increases as follows: 1d8 on levels 1-3, 2d6 on levels 4-7, 2d8 on levels 8-11, 3d6 on levels 12-15, 3d8 on levels 16-19, 4d8 on level 20.\n"
"<b>Improved Unarmed Strike</b>\n"
"You are considered to be armed even when unarmed — you can make unarmed attacks that deal 1d3 bludgeoning damage (if Medium, 1d2 if Small).\n"
"<b>AC Bonus</b>\n"
"When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Wisdom\"><b>Wisdom</b></link> bonus (if any) to his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Armor_Class\"><b>AC</b></link> and <link=\"Encyclopedia:CMD\"><b>CMD</b></link>. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.\n"
"These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.\n"
"<b>Stunning Fist</b>\n"
"You know just where to strike to temporarily stun a foe.\n"
"Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your next turn). A stunned character drops everything held, can't take actions, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a –2 penalty to AC. You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be stunned.\n"
"<b>Monk Bonus Feat</b>\n"
"At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Crane Style, Blind Fight, Improved Initiative\n"
"At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Trip, Improved Disarm\n"
"At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical.\n"
"A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.\n"
"<b>Evasion</b>\n"
"Character can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If a character makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. A helpless character does not gain the benefit of evasion.\n"
"<b>Improved Evasion</b>\n"
"This ability works like evasion, except that while the character still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless character does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.\n"
"<b>Ki Pool</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk's ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike.\n"
"At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n"
"At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n"
"At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n"
"At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.\n"
"By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.\n"
"The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.\n"
"<b>Fast Movement</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, a monk gains a 10 enhancement bonus to his land speed. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.\n"
"For every 3 levels above the 3rd the bonus improves by 10ft.\n"
"<b>Ki Strike – Magic</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, ki strike allows monk's unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n"
"<b>Still mind</b>\n"
"At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.\n"
"Ki Power\n"
"At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.\n"
"<b>Stunning Fist: Fatigue</b>\n"
"This ability works as Stunning Fist, but makes the target fatigued for 1 minute on a failed save instead of stunning for 1 round.\n"
"<b>Purity of Body</b>\n"
"At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.\n"
"<b>Style Strike</b>\n"
"At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type.\n"
"<b>Ki Strike — Cold Iron and Silver</b>\n"
"At 7th level, monk's unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n"
"<b>Stunning Fist: Sicken</b>\n"
"This ability works as Stunning Fist, but makes the target sickened for 1 minute on a failed save instead of stunning for 1 round.\n"
"<b>Ki Strike – Lawful</b>\n"
"At 10th level, monk's unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n"
"<b>Ki Strike – Adamantine</b>\n"
"At 16th level, monk's unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.\n"
"<b>Ki power: Perfect Self</b>\n"
"At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. The monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction.\n"
"<b>Selectable Features</b>\n"
"<b>Ki power: Abundant Step</b>\n"
"At 8th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door. Using this ability is a move action that consumes 2 points from his ki pool. He cannot take other creatures with him when he uses this ability.\n"
"<b>Ki power: Barkskin</b>\n"
"A monk with this ki power can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a standard action to grant himself a tough skin. The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to monk's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +5 at 12th level.\n"
"<b>Ki power: Cold Ice Strike</b>\n"
"A monk with this ki power can spend 3 point from his ki pool as a swift action to create a shredding flurry of ice slivers, which blast from his hand in a line. The line deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).\n"
"<b>Ki power: Diamond body</b>\n"
"A monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.\n"
"<b>Ki power: Diamond Soul</b>\n"
"A monk gains spell resistance equal to his current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.\n"
"<b>Ki power: Extra attack</b>\n"
"By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects.\n"
"<b>Ki power: Poison</b>\n"
"A monk with this ki power can spend 2 point from his ki pool as a standard action to infect the subject with a horrible poison by making a successful melee touch attack. This poison deals 1d3 Constitution damage per round for 6 rounds.\n"
"<b>Ki power: Quivering Palm</b>\n"
"A monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. Target must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier) or die. Using this ability is a standard action that costs 4 ki points.\n"
"<b>Ki power: Restoration</b>\n"
"A monk with this ki power can spend 2 point from his ki pool as a standard action to dispel temporary negative levels or one permanent negative level.\n"
"Restoration cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score. It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.\n"
"<b>Ki power: Scorching Ray</b>\n"
"A monk with this ki power can spend 2 point from his ki pool as a standard action to blast his enemies with a searing beam of fire. Monk may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage.\n"
"<b>Ki power: Shout</b>\n"
"A monk with this ki power can spend 3 point from his ki pool as a standard action to unleash a sudden blast of sonic energy that strikes his opponent. The target takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per level (maximum 20d6) and is stunned for 1 round; a successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the stun.\n"
"<b>Ki power: Spit Venom</b>\n"
"A monk with this ki power can spend 2 point from his ki pool as a standard action to spit a stream of venom at a target using a ranged touch attack. If the venom hits, it causes blindness for 1 round. The target must also save or be poisoned by black adder venom; the DC in successive rounds of the poison is equal to the spell's DC.\n"
"<b>Sensei Advice: Sudden Speed</b>\n"
"A monk with this ki power can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to grant himself a sudden burst of speed. This increases the monk's base land speed by 30 feet for 1 minute.\n"
"<b>Ki power: True Strike</b>\n"
"A monk with this ki power can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a standard action to gain temporary, intuitive insight into the immediate future during his next attack. Monk's next single attack roll (if it is made before the end of the next round) gains a +20 insight bonus. Additionally, he is not affected by the miss chance that applies to attackers trying to strike a concealed target.\n"
"<b>Ki power: Wholeness of Body</b>\n"
"By spending 2 point from his ki pool as a standard action monk can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to his monk level."

"Mystic theurges place no boundaries on their magical abilities and find no irreconcilable paradox in devotion to the arcane as well as the divine. They seek magic in all of its forms, finding no reason or logic in denying themselves instruction by limiting their knowledge to one stifling paradigm, though many are simply hungry for limitless power. No matter what their motivations, mystic theurges believe that perception is reality, and through the divine forces and astral energies of the multiverse, that perception can be used to manipulate and control not only the nature of this reality, but destiny itself.\n"
"Mystic theurges are drawn from multiclass spellcasters who can already cast both arcane and divine spells, and the powers that they gain increase their mastery over both.\n"
"<b>Class Details</b>\n"
"<b><link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\">Alignment</link>:</b> The motivations of a mystic theurge rarely stem from a sense of altruism or philanthropy, so most tend to be neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. Lawful mystic theurges, whether good, neutral, or evil, are rarer, and often use their powers for either the benefit — or control — of society. Chaotic mystic theurges are rarer still, as the calling generally requires great personal discipline.\n"
"<b>Hit Die:</b> d6.\n"
"<b>Requirements</b>\n"
"To qualify to become a mystic theurge, a character must fulfill all the following criteria:\n"
"<b>Skills:</b> Knowledge (Arcana) 3 ranks, Lore (Religion) 3 ranks.\n"
"<b>Spells:</b> Able to cast 2nd level divine spells and 2nd level arcane spells.\n"
"<b>Class Skills</b>\n"
"The mystic theurge's class skills are Knowledge (Arcana), Lore (Religion) and Perception.\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Combined Spells</b>\n"
"A mystic theurge can prepare and cast spells from one of his spellcasting classes using the available slots from any of his other spellcasting classes. Spells prepared or cast in this way take up a slot one level higher than they originally occupied. This ability cannot be used to cast a spell at a lower level if that spell exists on both spell lists. At 1st level, a mystic theurge can prepare 1st-level spells from one of his spellcasting classes using the 2nd-level slots of the other spellcasting class. Every two levels thereafter, the level of spells that can be cast in this way increases by one, to a maximum of 5th-level spells at 9th level (these spells would take up 6th-level spell slots). The components of these spells do not change, but they otherwise follow the rules for the spellcasting class used to cast the spell.\n"
"<b>Arcane Spellcasting</b>\n"
"At 1st level, the mystic theurge selects an arcane spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. When a new mystic theurge level is gained, the character gains new spells per day and new spells known as if she had also gained a level in that spellcasting class.\n"
"<b>Divine Spellcasting</b>\n"
"At 1st level, the mystic theurge selects a divine spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. When a new mystic theurge level is gained, the character gains new spells per day and new spells known as if she had also gained a level in that spellcasting class.\n"
"<b>Spell Synthesis</b>\n"
"At 10th level, a mystic theurge can as a standard action achieve the state of a perfect spell synthesis. For one minute after using this ability next spell from each of his selected spellcasting classes will be cast as a free action. A mystic theurge may use this ability once per day."

"Ancient Osirian legends speak of the god-king Nethys, a man whose monomaniacal pursuit of magic opened the fabric of reality to his probing vision, revealing to him the secrets of creation in this world and in the Great Beyond. The sight catapulted him to godhood and tore apart his sanity, creating two minds in one body. Now his fractured mind seeks both to cleanse the world through its destruction and to guard and heal it, to bend and preserve it, to conquer and free it. Nethys is a god of two warring personalities, prone to sudden and unexpected mood swings. He teaches that the use of magic for its own sake is the highest calling of mortals, for it is only through magic that one can change reality itself, and he embraces all who take up magical study. He does not care about the type of magic involved or the ends to which people turn it, only that they honor it and exult in its gifts. He represents all magic, from the most benign healing spells to the vilest necromancy, and mortal spellcasters of all alignments ask for his blessing.\n"
"Nethys's only concern is magic — its use, creation, and innovation. He is aware of his mortal worshipers and rewards their devotion with divine power, but not for their use of magic alone. When some mortal tyrant outlaws the use of magic, Nethys expects his followers to intervene, though he issues no call to crusade. Likewise, those who perceive new avenues of magic and pursue them gain his favor, regardless of the nature or purpose of the magic. His total awareness means he sees every success and every failure, from the first cantrip learned by a fledgling hedge wizard to the rudiments of star-exploding magic developed on the farthest-flung planet.\n"
"Other gods may take parental roles toward their churches, but Nethys acts more like the volatile but dispassionate guardian of an estate, unconcerned about individual heirs as long as the vast legacy of the family continues. Queries made of the All-Seeing Eye via commune and similar spells always give accurate information, but his tone might range from amused to cold to disappointed to enraged, seemingly without rhyme or reason. Other deities have tried to stabilize or cure his shattered mind and violent mood swings, but he inevitably perceives any progress as a depletion of his energy and negates their efforts. His allies have learned to tolerate his ever-changing nature, keeping him at a respectful arm's length for the sake of his knowledge.\n"
"Nethys is a proponent of magic for all purposes, even frivolous or wasteful ones. Magic is an infinite resource that permeates all dimensions, and thus he insists there is no need to limit its use for fear of its eventual depletion. He sees magic-drained places like the Mana Wastes as aberrations, tumors in the world that can be excised, though dealing with them is not a high priority unless they begin to grow and threaten the healthy flow of magic elsewhere. Nethys isn't averse to technology unless it interferes with or supplants magic; indeed, he relishes the blending of technology and magic.\n"
"Nethys normally appears as a male human crackling with power, one side of him burned and broken, the other half calm and serene. This duality is usually emphasized in artwork, which often depicts the god releasing terrible magic from his broken side even as he casts spells from his good side to heal the wounds he just caused. Though he is generally depicted as Garundi, some regional temples deviate from this by showing him as a member of a prominent local race or as an Azlanti.\n"
"Outside of promoting the use of magic and embracing those who engage in it, Nethys is supremely indifferent to both mortals and other deities. Pleas for mercy or justice, incitements to violence, and invocations of fairness or the balance of power have no effect on him; he acts in the interest of increasing magical knowledge or according to his whim, but is otherwise unpredictable and unreliable. He is not known for showing favor or wrath to his followers or enemies in the form of divine intervention, a fact that many of his worshipers note with some pride. Layfolk, especially peasants, believe that invoking his name may help to ward off curses, hexes, the evil eye, and other superstitions, though his utter disregard for those who do not practice magic means these invocations fall on deaf ears. The devout believe that zones of unpredictable magic manifest where Nethys passes close to the Material Plane, though there is no confirmation of this from the god himself. Likewise, his church teaches that the manifestation of zones of \"empty magic\" (where magic simply doesn't function) are indications of his anger at someone or something in that area, though there is no evidence that this is true.\n"
"His holy symbol is his face, half black and half white, which might be highly detailed or abstracted to little more than a two-tone, shield-shaped mask without holes.\n"

msgid ""
"Norgorber is one of the Ascended, a mortal who triumphed in the Test of the Starstone and took the mantle of the god of killers and spies. Little is known of his life as a mortal, for he has concealed this information so others can't use it against him — possibly murdering those who knew him. He has wiped knowledge of his past from even the memories of the other gods, becoming an enigma to all. Only his most favored worshipers know enough about his goals to help bring his plans to fruition in the world, and sometimes he wipes the knowledge from their minds when their tasks are done to better preserve his secrets. Some sages believe that if Norgorber's true nature were discovered, he would be undone — perhaps as a side effect of his passing the Test of the Starstone, or perhaps as fallout from some sacrifice he made for greater power. He is subtle, devious, and cunning, a cold killer who hides in shadows and trades on his power and information. He is a master of secrets, a true gamesman, and he welcomes all into his church — for eventually, all have secrets for which they would kill.\n"
"In artwork, Norgorber is most often represented only by his holy symbol: a featureless black mask, often polished to a mirror sheen. Some artists evoke his presence with a black masklike badge or an empty black glove, and worshipers have been known to nail a black glove to a door as a warning to someone who has offended the cult. He is sometimes shown as an invisible man dressed in the garb of a thief, or a hooded, spectre-like figure with an obscured face and sinister black gloves. Those who try to paint or sculpt him as a recognizable figure, even if the image is purely from the artist's imagination and not based on any knowledge or insight, find their hands fumbling and their work increasingly erratic. If they persist, their motor control is often permanently afflicted. Wiser priests of his church say this is because if the god blotted out only accurate depictions of him, mortals could deduce his true appearance by determining what they are not allowed to paint, so instead he hinders all attempts to portray his visage. When he manifests to mortals, he appears to be a normal human dressed in brown and black, of average height and build, always with his face concealed or entirely invisible, and vaguely threatening even when speaking pleasantly.\n"
"Norgorber treasures secrets like a merchant loves gold, whether the secret is his own or belongs to a mortal or supernatural creature. He trades them for more valuable secrets, gives them away if such knowledge serves his long-term goals, and takes them from volunteers who can't trust themselves not to speak of what they know. He modifies memories or kills to preserve secrets. He is not a god of lies, but will use them to protect the truth of the matter or make it more valuable, though he dislikes altering knowledge to change truth into falsehood. Norgorber understands that controlling something is having power over that thing, and having power leads to the desire for more. He knows there may be negative consequences for acting openly, and instead uses deceptive, circumspect, and insidious efforts like blackmail and poison. Of course, some poisons are merely an inconvenience to the target, while some targets are easier to eliminate than to threaten or persuade. Together, these ideas make Norgorber the god of secrets, greed, poison, and murder — four pernicious traits interwoven to create a treacherous whole.\n"
"Norgorber's realm in the Great Beyond is a network of sprawling tunnels and caverns beneath the perfect city of Axis. Its shadows and dark inhabitants hum silently with secret intent, bending the letter and spirit of Axis's laws but never going so far as to disrupt its perfect order. The domain connects to various points in Axis, sometimes in defiance of normal perceptions of time and space. Norgorber's presence and that of his followers is like the grease in a complex mechanism: messy and hidden away, but crucial to its overall function.\n"
"The god of secrets is subtle in his interventions. When he is pleased, a pickpocket finds a gold coin in an otherwise poor man's purse, a spy overhears a juicy bit of information from an unexpected source, a poisoned weapon retains its coating for a second attack, or a guard dies with only a quiet gurgle. When he's roused to anger, his ire is carefully measured. A thief finds she's lost the jewel she was supposed to steal, a speaker completely forgets whatever important topic he was talking about, an envenomed blade nicks the hand of a master assassin, or a skilled murderer finds himself downed by a lucky blow from an alley thug. Norgorber is disinclined to kill followers who fail him, provided they're still useful, and prefers to instead punish them with humiliation, sickness, or a crippling injury for a time, wiping key information from their minds to preserve his master plan. However, he has been known to dispose of those who are of no further use to him, especially those whose lives could be a threat to his objectives and whose deaths can serve as a lesson to surviving members of the cult.\n"

"The origin of the owlbear is a subject of great debate among scholars of the monstrous creatures of the world. However, most concur that at some point in the distant past, a deranged wizard created the original specimens by crossing an owl with a bear — perhaps as proof of some insane concept about the nature of life, but possibly out of sheer lunacy. Whatever the original purpose of such a freakish creation as the owlbear, the creature bred true and has become quite well established in woodlands across the world, where it plays a key role in a region's ecosystem as an apex predator.\n"
"Owlbears are notoriously bloodthirsty killers, well known for their short tempers, aggression, and savage nature. They tend to attack without provocation, slaughtering any living creatures that cross their paths.\n"
"Many scholars that have encountered these creatures in the wild have noted that they all have red-rimmed eyes that roll about wildly when they close in for an attack. This is sometimes presented as a sign of madness, suggesting that all owlbears are born with a pathological need to fight and kill, but more level-headed researchers believe that it's simply part of the way the massive bird-beast's keen eyes are constructed.\n"
"Owlbears generally inhabit desolate areas of the wilderness, making their messy lairs within wild forests or inside dark, shallow caverns. They are equally adept at hunting during the day and at night, depending upon the prey available near their lairs. Adult owlbears live in mated pairs, and hunt in small groups, leaving their young behind in their lairs while they search for prey.\n"
"While it is considered impossible to truly domesticate owlbears due to their feral natures, they can still be used as guardians if contained within an area but allowed to roam and hunt freely there. A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weighs up to 1,500 pounds."

"<b>Trapfinding</b>\n"
"The slayer gains Trickery as a class skill. The slayer also gains the trapfinding rogue ability, using his slayer level as his effective rogue level.\n"
"<b>Slayer Talents</b>\n"
"As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once.\n"
"Slayer can take rogue talents as slayer talents, counting his slayer level as rogue level.\n"
"After 2nd level, the slayer can select a ranger combat style (such as archery or two-weapon combat) and gains a combat feat from the first feat list of that style. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites. After 6th level, he may select this talent again and add the 6th-level ranger combat feats from his chosen style to the list. After 10th level, he may select this talent again and add the 10th-level ranger combat feats from his chosen style to the list.\n"

"Through a select, worthy few shines the power of the divine. Called paladins, these noble souls dedicate their swords and lives to the battle against evil. Knights, crusaders, and law-bringers, paladins seek not just to spread divine justice but to embody the teachings of the virtuous deities they serve. In pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of morality and discipline. As reward for their righteousness, these holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in their quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent, and inspire the faithful. Although their convictions might lead them into conflict with the very souls they would save, paladins weather endless challenges of faith and dark temptations, risking their lives to do right and fighting to bring about a brighter future.\n"
"<b>Role</b>: Paladins serve as beacons for their allies within the chaos of battle. While deadly opponents of evil, they can also empower goodly souls to aid in their crusades. Their magic and martial skills also make them well suited to defending others and blessing the fallen with the strength to continue fighting.\n"

"Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).\n"
"<b>Alignment Restriction</b>\n"
"A paladin who ceases to be lawful good loses all paladin spells and class features.\n"
"A druid who changes to a prohibited alignment loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she changes the alignment back.\n"
"<b>Deity Selection</b>\n"
"A deity, also known as a god or goddess, is a being or force of incredible power capable of granting its power to mortal beings through divine magic. A deity is strongly associated with a specific alignment, several domains, and a plane (typically an Outer Sphere plane).\n"
"<b>Smite Evil</b>\n"
"Once per day, a paladin can call out to the powers of good to aid her in her struggle against evil. As a swift action, the paladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, the paladin adds her <link=\"Encyclopedia:Charisma\"><b>Charisma</b></link> bonus (if any) to her attack rolls and adds her paladin level to all damage rolls made against the target of her smite. If the target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the paladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.\n"
"In addition, while smite evil is in effect, the paladin gains a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma modifier (if any) to her AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect.\n"
"The smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the paladin rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day.\n"
"<b>Divine Grace</b>\n"
"At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all <link=\"Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw\"><b>Saving Throws</b></link>.\n"
"<b>Lay On Hands — Others</b>\n"
"Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 her paladin level plus her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, a paladin can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin levels she possesses. Using this ability is a standard action, unless the paladin targets herself, in which case it is a swift action.\n"
"Alternatively, a paladin can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the paladin possesses. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage.\n"
"<b>Aura of Courage</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.\n"
"This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.\n"
"<b>Divine Health</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, a paladin is immune to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases, including mummy rot.\n"
"<b>Mercy</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a paladin can select one mercy.\n"
"Each mercy adds an effect to the paladin's lay on hands ability. Whenever the paladin uses lay on hands to heal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effects from all of the mercies possessed by the paladin.\n"
"<b>Channel Positive Energy</b>\n"
"When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to channel positive energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of her lay on hands ability. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the creatures targeted.\n"
"Paladin channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures.\n"
"Channeling positive energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the paladin. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two paladin levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the paladin's level + the paladin's Charisma modifier. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess healing is lost.\n"
"This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.\n"
"<b>Divine Weapon Bond (+1)</b>\n"
"Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin forms a divine bond with her weapon. As a standard action she can call upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 1 minute per paladin level.\n"
"At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5.\n"
"Alternatively, they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: axiomatic, brilliant energy, defending, disruption, flaming, flaming burst, holy, keen, and speed. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost. These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack.\n"
"A paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.\n"
"<b>Aura of Resolve</b>\n"
"At 8th level, a paladin is immune to charm spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm effects.\n"
"This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.\n"
"<b>Aura of justice</b>\n"
"At 11th level, a paladin can expend two uses of her smite evil ability to grant the ability to smite evil to all allies for 1 minute, using her bonuses. As a swift action, the paladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, paladins allies add her Cha bonus (if any) to their attack rolls and add her Paladin level to all damage rolls made against the target of her smite. Smite evil attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.\n"
"In addition, while smite evil is in effect, paladins allies gain a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma modifier (if any) to their AC against attacks made by the target of this smite. If the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, this smite is wasted with no effect.\n"
"<b>Aura of Faith</b>\n"
"At 14th level, a paladin's weapons are treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming Damage Reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of her is treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming Damage Reduction.\n"
"This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.\n"
"<b>Aura of Righteousness</b>\n"
"At 17th level, a paladin gains DR 5/evil and immunity to compulsion spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against compulsion effects.\n"
"This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.\n"
"<b>Holy Champion</b>\n"
"At 20th level, a paladin becomes a conduit for the power of her god. Her DR increases to 10/evil and whenever she channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature, she heals the maximum possible amount."

"In art, Pharasma is depicted as a midwife, a mad prophet, or a reaper of the dead, depending upon her role. Her visage usually has gray skin, white eyes, and white hair. As the midwife, she is efficient and severe, hair pulled back and arms bare from hands to the elbows. Pregnant women often carry tokens of this image on long necklaces to protect their unborn children and grant them good lives. As the prophet, Pharasma is wild-eyed and tangle-haired, and her words echo like thunder. As the reaper, she is tall and gaunt, with a hooded black gown and an hourglass with fast-flowing red sand, and is often shown seated on her throne and passing judgment on mortal souls.\n"
"Situated atop an impossibly tall spire, Pharasma's realm in the afterworld — the Boneyard — looms over the perfectly ordered city-plane of Axis. When mortals die, their souls join the vast River of Souls that flows through the Astral Plane, and eventually deposits them in Pharasma's Boneyard at the top of her spire. Once there, they stand in a great line, filtered through several courts according to their alignment and supposed planar destination. Those who die before experiencing their full fate might be lucky enough to return in this life or the next, either spontaneously or by getting called home by resurrection magic, but more often those who feel that they've met an untimely end discover that their destiny was in fact always leading them to their particular moment of death, however unjust or ignoble. Though she allows resurrection, the Lady of Graves opposes undeath as a desecration of the memory of the flesh and a corruption of a soul's path on its journey to her judgment. She encourages her followers to hunt undead, as the souls of the destroyed undead will then reach her for judgment.\n"
"At the heart of the Boneyard is Pharasma's Palace, a gothic structure built over the exact center of the Spire. Psychopomps walk its pathways and quietly fly above its walls, performing the administration of souls, and Pharasma's faithful are housed within. Despite its light color and mood, the Palace is obviously a creation of the goddess. It's unknown whether she made the Spire itself.\n"
"Pharasma manifests her favor through the appearance of scarab beetles and whippoorwills, both of which function as psychopomps (both in the figurative sense as guides for dead souls, as well as in the literal sense as manifestations of the outsiders called psychopomps). Black roses are thought to invite her favor and good luck, especially if the stems sport no thorns. Her displeasure is often signified by cold chills down the spine, bleeding from the nose or under the fingernails, an unexplained taste of rich soil, the discovery of a dead whippoorwill, or the feeling that something important has been forgotten. Pharasma also sometimes allows the spirits of those who have died under mysterious conditions to transmit short messages to their living kin to comfort them, expose a murderer, or haunt an enemy.\n"
"Pharasma's holy symbol is a spiral of light, representing a soul, its journey from birth to death to the afterlife, and the confusing path of deciphering prophecy.\n"

"Purple worms are giant scavengers that inhabit the deepest regions of the world, consuming any organic material that they encounter. They are notorious for swallowing their prey whole. It is not uncommon to hear of a group of adventurers vanishing down the ravenous maw of a purple worm, screaming as they disappear one by one.\n"
"Although they seek to consume living creatures, purple worms also consume vast amounts of dirt and minerals as they burrow underground. The insides of a purple worm may contain a considerable number of gemstones and other items able to withstand the corrosive acid inside its gullet. In areas filled with valuable minerals, such as those near dwarven mines, the natural tunnels created by burrowing purple worms are often filled with vast amounts of unrefined ores.\n"
"A purple worm usually claims a large underground cavern as its den, and while it returns here to rest and digest food, it spends the majority of its time on the prowl, burrowing through the endless dark or slithering along established tunnels in the constant drive to feed its immense hunger. Although not completely mindless, purple worms are rather stupid. They make popular guardians for those who have the magic to control them or a chamber in their lair large enough to hold one captive.\n"
"Although the deep-dwelling purple worm is the most common of its ilk, variant immense worms of differing colors dwell in other remote wildernesses. A sleek, mottled blue-and-green variant of the giant worm dwells in deep underground lakes or tropical seas (this variant loses its burrow speed but increases its swim speed to 40 feet). A deep crimson variant of even greater size dwells in remote badlands and rocky deserts (this variant is never less than Colossal in size). Other species doubtless remain to be discovered in the far corners of the world."

"For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game — even fugitives among their own people.\n"
"<b>Role</b>: Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.\n"
"<b>Alignment:</b> Any\n"
"<b>Hit Die:</b> d10\n"
"<b>Skill Ranks per Level:</b> 3 + Int modifier\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Ranger Proficiencies</b>\n"
"A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).\n"
"<b>Favored Enemy</b>\n"
"At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them.\n"
"At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.\n"
"If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from—those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.\n"
"<b>Combat Style Feat</b>\n"
"At 2nd level, a ranger must select one combat style to pursue.\n"
"The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.\n"
"<b>Favored Terrain</b>\n"
"At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and <link=\"Encyclopedia:Knowledge_World\"><b>Knowledge (World)</b></link>, <link=\"Encyclopedia:Lore_Nature\"><b>Lore (Nature)</b></link>, <link=\"Encyclopedia:Perception\"><b>Perception</b></link>, and <link=\"Encyclopedia:Stealth\"><b>Stealth</b></link> skill checks when he is in this terrain.\n"
"At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.\n"
"<b>Hunter's Bond</b>\n"
"At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.\n"
"The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: eagle, dog, or wolf. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.\n"
"This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level –3.\n"
"<b>Evasion</b>\n"
"Character can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If a character makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. A helpless character does not gain the benefit of evasion.\n"
"<b>Improved Evasion</b>\n"
"This ability works like evasion, except that while the character still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless character does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.\n"
"<b>Camouflage</b>\n"
"A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even while being observed.\n"
"<b>Master Hunter</b>\n"
"A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.\n"
"<b>Selectable Features</b>\n"
"<b>Ranger Style</b>\n"
"<b>Archery</b>\n"
"At 2nd level, ranger can select Far Shot, Focused Shot, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, and Rapid Shot.\n"
"At 6th level, he adds Crossbow Mastery, Improved Precise Shot, Parting Shot, Point Blank Master and Manyshot to the list.\n"
"At 10th level, he adds Pinpoint Targeting and Shot on the Run to the list."

"Rocs are terrifying, legendary birds renowned for their ability to carry off elephants and other big animals. A typical roc is 30 feet long from beak to tail, with an 80-foot wingspan and weight of up to 8,000 pounds. While their beaks are hooked like an eagle's and designed for slashing and tearing, most rocs prefer to seize prey in their massive, clawed talons and drop them from great heights before feasting on the shattered remains. For this reason, they are often followed by flocks of scavengers like rooks, buzzards, and eagles hoping to steal portions of the roc's messy meals. The roc generally ignores such opportunists, but if the scavengers don't take care, they nevertheless may find themselves accidentally consumed by the feeding roc.\n"
"Rocs are equally comfortable over land and sea. While they are capable of sleeping in the air as they soar solo across great ranges in search of food, they generally return home to the mountains to roost and procreate. They prefer rocky crags that are completely inaccessible by terrestrial means, building vast nests of tree trunks and ruined masonry. Once a decade, a mated pair lays a clutch of 3–5 eggs and raises its young. Outside of mating, rocs are extremely antisocial, and may attack others of their kind in vicious aerial battles in order to establish their territorial boundaries. When a nest contains eggs or chicks, parents trade off in their long-ranging flights, with one restricting its wanderings to within a 10-mile radius of the nest.\n"
"Rocs are most commonly white but can be a number of different colors, from dark brown or gold to black or blood red. Their massive feathers are highly prized, and their eggs even more so. Due to their scarcity and the high risk involved in harvesting them, a single man-sized roc egg can net 4,000 gp if transported to market undamaged. A roc can be trained as well as any other animal, but its great size makes this a daunting task for most would-be trainers of human size. The same isn't true for giants — particularly cloud and storm giants, who often use trained rocs as guardians for their lairs. Rocs are even large enough to serve as mounts for the most prestigious of giants.\n"
"Rocs taken as animal companions by <link=\"Encyclopedia:Druid\"><b>druids</b></link> or <link=\"Encyclopedia:Ranger\"><b>rangers</b></link> are typically newly hatched birds — a baby roc is the size of a person and ready for flight and hunting within minutes of hatching. Unfortunately for druids seeking animal companions of legendary size, an animal companion roc is limited to Large size — still large enough for a Medium druid or ranger to use the flying beast as a mount."

Most, however, excel in overcoming hindrances of all types, from unlocking doors and disarming traps to outwitting magical hazards and conning dull-witted opponents.\n"
"<b>Unchained:</b> While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the original rogue, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue's edge ability ties into a new system called skill unlocks. With this feature, the unchained rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.\n"

"<b>Hit Die:</b> d8\n"
"<b>Skill Ranks per Level:</b> 4 + Int modifier\n"
"<b>Sneak Attack</b>\n"
"If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.\n"
"The rogue's attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.\n"
"With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack — not even with the usual –4 penalty.\n"
"The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.\n"
"<b>Weapon Finesse</b>\n"
"With a light weapon, elven curve blade, estoc or rapier made for a creature of your size category, you may use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a shield, its armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.\n"
"<b>Trapfinding</b>\n"
"A rogue adds 1/2 her level to Perception checks.\n"
"<b>Evasion</b>\n"
"Character can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If a character makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. A helpless character does not gain the benefit of evasion.\n"
"<b>Rogue Talent</b>\n"
"As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.\n"
"<b>Advanced Talents</b>\n"
"After 10th level, a character can choose one of the advanced rogue talents in place of a rogue talent.\n"
"<b>Danger Sense:</b> At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).\n"
"<b>Debilitating Injury</b>\n"
"At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.\n"
"<b>Bewildered:</b> The target becomes bewildered, taking a –2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional –2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by –2 (to a total maximum of –8).\n"
"<b>Disoriented:</b> The target takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional –2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by –2 (to a total maximum of –8).\n"
"<b>Hampered:</b> All of the target's speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet).\n"
"These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.\n"
"<b>Uncanny Dodge</b>\n"
"The character can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A character with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.\n"
"If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.\n"
"<b>Improved Uncanny Dodge</b>\n"
"A character can no longer be flanked.\n"
"This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.\n"
"Prerequisites: Advanced Talents\n"
"<b>Master Strike</b>\n"
"At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue's master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.\n"

"Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you make using the selected weapon.\n"
"Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.\n"
"Prerequisites: BaseAttackBonus 1\n"
"<b>Advanced Talents:</b>\n"
"<b>Confounding Blades</b>\n"
"When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee weapon that deals sneak attack damage, her target cannot make attacks of opportunity for 1d4+1 rounds.\n"
"Prerequisites: Advanced Talents, Slow Reactions\n"
"<b>Crippling Strike</b>\n"
"A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage.\n"
"Prerequisites: Advanced Talents, Sneak Attack\n"
"<b>Dispelling Attack</b>\n"
"An opponent that is dealt sneak attack damage by a rogue with this ability is affected by a targeted dispel magic affecting the lowest-level spell effect active on the target. The caster level for this ability is equal to the rogue's level.\n"
"Prerequisites: Advanced Talents\n"
"<b>Double Debilitation</b>\n"
"Whenever the rogue inflicts a penalty against a target using the debilitating injury class feature, she can select two penalties to inflict. The target can never be subject to more than two penalties in this way at one time. If any additional penalties are inflicted, any previous penalties immediately end. Any effect that heals damage to the target negates both of the penalties.\n"
"Prerequisites: Advanced Talents, Debilitating Injury\n"
"<b>Improved Evasion</b>\n"
"This works like evasion, except while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack, she also takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.\n"
"Prerequisites: Advanced Talents\n"
"<b>Opportunist</b>\n"
"The rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as an attack of opportunity for that round and can't be used more than once per round.\n"
"Prerequisites: Advanced Talents"

"Spawned to destroy worlds, Rovagug tore into existence while the cosmos was still young, devouring and destroying everything he touched and laying waste to the careful creations of the gods. Trapped by a union of desperate deities, Rovagug shudders in anguish and impotent rage, causing the earth to shake and mountains to crumble. He bellows and clouds of toxic gas billow from rents in the ground. He births monstrosities that clamber from the rotted depths of the world to ravage and destroy in their creator's place. Rovagug does not dream of glory or wonders. He dreams of the end of existence, shoveling all that lives into his devouring maw and crushing all that does not beneath his terrifying form. His ruin is not slow entropy but rather destructive fire. All rational beings, divine and mortal, hate and fear him, for he is the hastener of the end, the Unmaker, enemy of the gods and of life itself.\n"
"Upon Rovagug's arrival from somewhere beyond the depths of space and time, he launched a vicious war that eventually prompted an unprecedented alliance among all the gods as they sought to defend all they had created. While wily Calistria distracted the terror and countless now-forgotten gods gave their lives to aid her, Torag and Gorum forged an unbreakable prison in the heart of Golarion, and Asmodeus and Pharasma drew upon the power of the planes to fit it with potent magical locks and wards. When the sign was given that the work was complete, the great angel Sarenrae challenged Rovagug directly, taunting him with holy fire. His profane howls of rage and anguish shook the void as the Dawnflower lured him close to the world that would be his prison, and with her blazing sword, sliced a great rift deep into the land's heart. Power beyond mortal comprehension, born of the toil of dozens of gods and paid for with the lives of dozens more, lashed out and ensnared the destroyer, drawing him into the god-forged prison. As the cell quaked and threatened to buckle around its furious captive, Asmodeus used his Hell-forged key to lock the Rough Beast away for all time.\n"
"Bound for millennia, the Rough Beast has nursed his rage, believing that one day he will break free and feast upon Sarenrae, the fragments of the world, and the cooling flesh of all the other gods. He sleeps fitfully for centuries at a time, comforted by dreams of annihilation. Rovagug is the cancer at Golarion's heart, straining and struggling against his bonds until the day when he will consume all life.\n"
"There is nothing beneficent about the Rough Beast, no creation to offset his destruction. He has no friends or allies; once he has devoured the world, he will surely turn on even his own spawn and devour them in a cannibalistic orgy. The Rough Beast is indifferent to the petty things mortals do in his honor, or whether they speak his name with adoration or loathing. He requires no special rituals and demands no heartfelt devotion as a channel for his divine energy—he wishes only to be set free, and to know that he is not forgotten. Though some of his faithful may believe otherwise, he promises no honored place at his side or immunity from his destruction. The lucky ones may ride in his wake for a time, reveling in unbridled obliteration, but eventually they too will be consumed by their god's terrible hunger.\n"
"Rovagug's imprisonment limits his interaction with both mortal and immortal beings. His intervention in the world must be through his violent priests and, more infamously, through his titanic spawn, which act as his host of catastrophic heralds. Few civilized cultures attempt to depict the Rough Beast as anything more than a wormlike creature with a great toothy maw, and the primitive tribes and mad cultists who worship him are satisfied with simple depictions painted in blood on walls, banners, and shields. His symbol is a fanged mouth surrounded by spider legs, though individual cults might use slightly different symbols such as a crab with a mouth on its back, a maw surrounded by scorpion stingers, or a crude drawing of a claw encircled by a spiral. He has many names used by various tribes and cults, including the Tide of Fangs, the Imprisoned King, and the Worldbreaker. Rovagug's true form is maddening: a miles-long worm with countless limbs stretching along his length and grasping from within his mouth. Various parasitic creatures cling to his skin and spill forth from his wounds; some of them are sluglike or insectile, many are swarms of thousand-legged vermin, and others take more unspeakable shapes. These parasites voraciously consume those foolish enough to be caught in the wake of Rovagug's spilled blood, then die, unable to sustain their own existence apart from the god's flesh.\n"
"After earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur, Rovagug's cultists pray and make sacrifices to wake him, believing such events are manifestations of his restless slumber. They see storms and toxic gas vents as his breath coursing up from the dark places in the world. If these things afflict the enemies of the cult, the faithful take it as a sign of their god's favor; he is clearly displeased if such natural disasters harm his worshipers.\n"

"Sarenrae is one of the most popular deities on Golarion, and followers of many other faiths respect her power, dedication, and generosity. Once a powerful angel known as an empyreal lord, Sarenrae led the heavenly hosts in the charge against the Rough Beast, Rovagug, and it was she who dealt him the great blow that led to his chaining. Now a goddess in her own right, Sarenrae is kind and loving, a figure of light, guidance, and healing, and has great patience with those who choose to be blind but may one day see. Yet for all her compassion, Sarenrae is also a powerful force against evil, and strikes down the irredeemable without mercy. Her faith is ancient; it first became popular among Keleshite humans, then spread to the Garundi in ancient Osirion and into other human and nonhuman civilizations as well.\n"
"Eons ago, Sarenrae was an angel guiding the energies of the sun and battling evil beings that sought to plunge the newborn world of Golarion and its sister planets into eternal darkness. Other angels lent her their support and turned to her for leadership in these battles, and eventually gods joined them as she grew in power to become one of the mighty empyreal lords. Sarenrae was the first to stand against Rovagug's attempts to unmake Golarion, and she faced the Rough Beast personally when the other forces of creation were engaged with his hideous spawn. The exact circumstances of the battle are a mystery to mortals, but it is believed that her willingness to sacrifice herself for the good of all inspired her flagging comrades to new hope and courage, and elevated her from one of the greatest angels to a full goddess. With this influx of power, she smote Rovagug and hurled his broken body deep into the earth. As the gods healed the planet's scars and intelligent life appeared on its surface, mortals turned their eyes upward to thank the life-giving sun, and her faith took root among primitive peoples.\n"
"Sarenrae is a goddess of boundless love and exquisite kindness, a caring friend, mother, sister, and protector of all in need. She delights in healing the sick, lifting up the fallen, and shining a guiding light into the darkest hearts and lands. She brushes off insults and deflects attacks, patiently trying to convince those who perceive her as an enemy that their belief is false. For all her patience and gentleness, however, she is no victim: if it becomes clear that her efforts are wasted, she responds to violence and predations upon the innocent with cleansing fire and scorching light. She dislikes cruelty, lies, needless suffering, and thoughtless destruction. Ancient and timeless, she stands fearlessly against the full tide of darkness, promising that the dawn will always come, and with it, hope, truth, and kindness will triumph.\n"
"Religious art depicts the sun goddess as a woman with bronze skin and hair of dancing flame; in some cases this flame trails behind her for a dozen or more yards. One of her hands offers the light of the sun, while the other wields a scimitar against those who would spread darkness, hatred, and pain. The church does not teach that Sarenrae is the sun itself; rather, she is its guardian and conduit for its power, and while fanciful art may show her face in place of the sun, the mainstream faithful recognize the difference between the star and the goddess.\n"
"The Dawnflower's faith is a broad one, and the majority of her worshipers are everyday folk who recognize the power of the sun, take comfort in the idea of a deity's love and compassion, and believe strongly in both redemption and righteous action. Her faith attracts those with kind hearts who are nevertheless willing to harden them when kindness is a dangerous weakness. The faith makes few demands of its everyday adherents beyond these tenets, and its clergy are usually seen as valiant protectors and enlightened teachers.\n"
"Sarenrae indicates her favor with sightings of doves, rays of dawn or dusk sunlight that last far longer than they should, the discovery of yellow stones or gems, or the sudden soothing of aches and pains. Her displeasure is most often made apparent through unexplained sunburns or periods of blindness that can last anywhere from only a few moments for minor transgressions to a lifetime for mortal sins. Her holy symbol is an ankh, though more stylized versions show a winged ankh or a winged female figure with arms outstretched and a halo of flame. Her titles include the Dawnflower and the Cleansing Light—to her enemies, she is the Warrior of Fire.\n"

"Satyrs, known in some regions as fauns, are debauched and hedonistic creatures of the deepest, most primeval parts of the woods. They adore wine, music, and carnal delights, and are renowned as rakes and smooth-talkers, wooing unwary maidens and shepherd boys and leaving a trail of awkward explanations and unplanned pregnancies in their wakes.\n"
"Though their bodies are almost always those of attractive and well-built men, much of the satyrs' talent for seduction lies in their talent for music. With the aid of his eponymous pipes, a satyr is capable of weaving a wide variety of melodic spells designed to enchant others and bring them in line with his capricious desires. In addition to their constant frolicking, satyrs often act as guardians of the creatures in their forest homes, and any who manage to turn the satyr's lust to wrath are likely to find themselves facing down dangerous animals surrounding the faun.\n"
"Still, while satyrs tend to value their own amusement well above the rights of others, they bear no ill will toward those they seduce. Children born from such encounters are always full-blooded satyrs, and are generally spirited away by their riotous kin soon after birth."

"Shambling mounds, also called shamblers, appear to be heaps of rotting vegetation. They are actually intelligent, carnivorous plants with a fondness for elf flesh in particular.\n"
"What serve as a shambler's brain and sensory organs are located in its upper body. Shambling mounds typically have an 8-foot girth and stand between 6 and 9 feet tall. They weigh about 3,800 pounds.\n"
"Shambling mounds are strange creatures, more akin to animate tangles of creeping parasitic vines than single rooted plants. They are omnivorous, able to draw their sustenance from nearly anything, wrapping their creepers around living trees to draw forth the sap, sending rootlets into the soil to absorb raw nutrients, or consuming f lesh and bone from crushed prey.\n"
"Shamblers are frighteningly stealthy in their native environments. Blending in with the surrounding terrain, they can lie in wait for days on end without moving, waiting patiently for a potential meal. A shambler could be almost anywhere at any time, attacking without warning and not caring whether it leaves any survivors, so long as it acquires its next meal.\n"
"Shambling mounds normally lead solitary, nomadic existences in deep forests and fetid swamps, although they can also be found underground living among damp fungal thickets. Disturbing rumors persist, however, of shamblers gathering in strange congregations around great earthen mounds in the depths of marshes and jungles, often during the height of violent electrical storms. Their reasons for doing so are unknown, and many sages have wondered whether there is some obscure and alien purpose at work."

"Shelyn has watched over the multiverse with a gentle heart and generous eye since the beginnings of sentience, encouraging mortals in peace and love and reveling in even their crudest artistic awakenings. A passionate and creative artist in both matters of the heart and works of beauty, she teaches that true beauty takes many forms, that kindness is its own form of strength, that no force is more powerful than love, and that every person is beautiful in some way. She has experienced enough pain herself to recognize the sting of sacrifice, and has soothed enough broken hearts to know that love and beauty are not easy things. Yet despite the realities of pain and loss, she remains an eternal optimist, helping to mend the deepest pains and turn the coldest hearts toward love and light. No mortal, monster, or deity is immune to her power.\n"
"Shelyn represents all aspects of love, whether a parent's devotion to his child, companionship with a beloved pet, the steady tenderness of an old couple, the chaste adoration of a paladin for a deity, or the passion of new lovers. She prefers relationships based on more than just carnal desire; while she does not oppose such relationships, she hopes that such physical trysts blossom into something deeper. Likewise, she does not consider greed or craving true love, whether directed toward riches or an uninterested person.\n"
"Shelyn is always shown as a young woman with eyes of blue or silver (or sometimes one eye of each color) and ankle-length hair adorned with colorful strands. She is usually depicted as a human, though other races often illustrate her as one of their own, from elves to half-orcs. Shelyn always wears tasteful clothing and jewelry that accentuate her beauty without revealing too much of it. Her physical proportions vary depending on the artist and regional standards for beauty: she is strong and sturdy in some depictions, voluptuous in others, and slender in still others. When she chooses to appear to mortals, it's usually as a brown-haired Taldan woman of average proportions and exceptional beauty, dressed in attractive but comfortable clothing. Her avatar is the embodiment of passion, energy, and devotion, and nearby objects and even the air and light themselves bend toward her as if in ecstasy.\n"
"Shelyn is the daughter of an unknown mother and the spirit-wolf Thron, the Prince That Howls. In primordial times, Thron roamed the mountains, forests and skies, singing his feral ode to life, song, and love. From his many unions came two children greater than he: his daughter Shelyn and his son Dou-Bral, who as the only close relatives among the major deities of Golarion shared the divine portfolio of love, beauty, art, and music. Ages ago, the siblings quarreled, and Dou-Bral departed to regions past the edge of the Great Beyond, abandoning his divine interests and responsibilities. When he returned, he was transformed into the dark god Zon-Kuthon, twisted by the things he'd experienced beyond the borders of existence into a dark mirror of his former self. His devotion to beauty had become mastery of mutilation, love had become misery, music had become screams, and the art of creation had become the craft of torture. He mutilated and reshaped his own father into his herald, a thing of pain and horror (see page 314). When Shelyn reached out to greet her lost brother, he pierced her hand with his black nails, and responded to her tears and pleading with violence. The siblings battled again, and eventually the goddess wrested his glaive from him (thinking it was the source of his corruption). The two declared a truce, a tenuous peace of silence and avoidance. Despite the hurts he has caused, Shelyn believes that her brother still exists within the twisted thing that he has become, and hopes to someday redeem him. Her story of love and devotion despite sorrow inspires mortal friends and lovers to persevere in adverse circumstances, bards to craft epic songs and tragedies, and artists to create works that touch the soul.\n"
"Shelyn sometimes contacts her faithful directly, but she prefers to work through reassuring thoughts, reminders of loved ones, or memories of favored music. Songbirds are sacred to her church, their presence being considered good luck. Most of her temples include feeders on the roof or in nearby trees to encourage birds to visit and nest nearby. Especially blessed artists may receive visions of Shelyn's realm to inspire their works, and bereaved lovers may experience dreams of walks in the realm's rose gardens with their deceased loves. Shelyn's displeasure manifests in a number of ways, such as a brief glimpse of a repellent reflection in a mirror, a lover's quarrel, a bird singing off-key, or wilted roses. She is greatly saddened by those who betray the ones they love, and haunts such folk within her congregation with guilt and the subtle sounds of those they betrayed until they either genuinely ask for forgiveness or abandon her faith entirely.\n"
"Shelyn's holy symbol is a songbird with rainbow feathers, and her weapon is the glaive Whisperer of Souls, seized from her brother Zon-Kuthon and claimed as her own. She keeps the weapon as a reminder of her brother's transformation and to show her worshipers that it is sometimes necessary to fight for the things you love.\n"

"A shocker lizard has a pale yellow underside, with bright green scales elsewhere on its 3-foot-long body, and weighs about 25 pounds. Shocker lizards tend toward group living, as their electrical abilities grow in power when they are close to another lizard.\n"
"A shocker lizard colony is usually located near a source of water. Once the colony has settled on a location, the lizards become very territorial and attack anything that intrudes on them. A solitary shocker lizard is a timid and hesitant creature — but when several of them gather they become formidable and fearsome opponents capable of killing creatures several times their own size.\n"
"A shocker lizard relies on its electricity abilities in combat, and a tends to bite only after its shock has rendered an opponent unconscious, or when the shock seems to have no effect at all. A solitary lizard flees once it delivers its shocks, but if other shocker lizards are nearby, they all hone in on their comrade's discharges and attempt to administer lethal shocks to their foe.\n"
"Many have attempted to capture and tame shocker lizards, but this often proves a difficult and painful task. Alone and in captivity, shocker lizards tend to wither and die swiftly unless their keepers spend a lot of time grooming and playing with the lizards to keep them company. Kept in pairs or larger numbers, captive shocker lizards thrive, but their increasing electrical ability makes them more difficult to manage for keepers who aren't themselves immune to electricity."

"No simple garden pests, giant slugs pose a serious threat to those caught in their path. Folk who dwell near swamps and other regions that support giant slugs risk losing livestock and even their homes to these enormous beasts. Giant slugs constantly wander in search of food, their preference being fleshy organic material, which they slice into smaller, easily gulped chunks with their rasp-like tongues.\n"
"What strange influence might have caused the first giant slugs to grow to such monstrous proportions is unknown, but today, giant slugs breed true and birth their oversized offspring after a fleshy, squirming courtship ritual. After mating, a female giant slug lays just over a hundred eggs, each approximately a foot in diameter. The mother slug guards this clutch fiercely and aggressively attacks any creatures that wander too close. Giant slugs inhabiting swamps aboveground mate once a year, and those who live in the area know better than to go into the swamps during this month.\n"
"Deep below ground, some subterranean races use giant slugs as mounts or guardians. Creatures like mites, who have a strange empathy with vermin, can be used to keep giant slugs docile, but in most cases, those who would use giant slugs must do so with great care, keeping them well fed until they are needed for battle. Frightened whispers report armies of troglodytes using giant slugs as siege mounts. One particularly disturbing tale mentions a vast underground cavern inhabited by scores of skum and aboleth-controlled aquatic giant slugs with strange, mind-numbing abilities infused into their acidic saliva."

"Slurks are carnivores and have a formidable bite, thanks to their massive tusks. Their true strength, however, lies in their foul-smelling and unnatural secretions. The mucus exuded from the slurk's back is incredibly sticky and quickly hardens into a powerful resin, a quality the creature turns to its advantage by squirting it at intruders and then waiting for it to harden before closing for the kill. At the same time, the liquid excreted by glands on a slurk's stomach is incredible slippery, allowing the slurk to keep from being immobilized by its own back slime and also making it extremely hard to grapple or maneuver without its consent. Combined with slurks' natural ability to climb walls and hang from ceilings with ease, these abilities make the foul-smelling creatures extremely desirable to kobolds, who domesticate and train the frogbeasts as powerful mounts and guardians."

When combating a foe, the saber-tooth bites and rakes with its claws.

"Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of fickle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw forth might few mortals can imagine. Emboldened by lives ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their birthright and coax forth ever greater arcane feats. Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters' abilities and inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their gifts. While some seek to control their abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live and breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to mastering, and for them magic is more than a boon or a field of study; it is life itself.\n"
"<b>Role</b>: Sorcerers excel at casting a selection of favored spells frequently, making them powerful battle mages. As they become familiar with a specific and ever-widening set of spells, sorcerers often discover new and versatile ways of making use of magics other spellcasters might overlook. Their bloodlines also grant them additional abilities, assuring that no two sorcerers are ever quite alike.\n"

"<b>Skill Ranks per Level:</b> 1 + Int modifier\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Sorcerer Proficiencies</b>\n"
"Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a sorcerer's gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.\n"
"<b>Cantrips</b>\n"
"Sorcerers can cast a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.\n"
"<b>Sorcerer Bonus Feat</b>\n"
"At 1th level, a sorcerer gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose a metamagic feat, spell focus feat or any other spellcaster feat. The sorcerer must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.\n"
"<b>Bloodline</b>\n"
"Each sorcerer has a source of magic somewhere in her heritage that grants her spells, bonus feats, an additional class skill, and other special abilities. This source can represent a blood relation or an extreme event involving a creature somewhere in the family's past. For example, a sorcerer might have a dragon as a distant relative or her grandfather might have signed a terrible contract with a devil. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways as the sorcerer gains levels. A sorcerer must pick one bloodline upon taking her first level of sorcerer. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.\n"
"At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a sorcerer learns an additional spell, derived from her bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on new levels. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.\n"
"At 7th level, and every six levels thereafter, a sorcerer receives one bonus feat, chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The sorcerer must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.\n"
"Filled with magical power that screams for release, sorcery is not so much a calling as a blessing—or a curse. For some sorcerers, this arcane birthright manifests in subtle and carefully controlled ways, assisting in their manipulation of others or the pursuit of lofty goals. For others, it is wild and unpredictable, the primal and explosive lashing out of a power greater than themselves.\n"
"<b>Bloodline Feat Selection</b>\n"
"At 7th level, and every six levels thereafter, a sorcerer receives one bonus feat, chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The sorcerer must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.\n"
"<b>Selectable Features</b>\n"
"<b>Bloodlines:</b>\n"
"<b>Abyssal Bloodline:</b> Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into your heritage. While it does not manifest in all of your kin, for you it is particularly strong. You might sometimes have urges to chaos or evil, but your destiny (and alignment) is up to you.\n"
"<b>Celestial Bloodline:</b> Your bloodline is blessed by a celestial power, either from a celestial ancestor or through divine intervention. Although this power drives you along the path of good, your fate (and alignment) is your own to determine.\n"
"<b>Fey Bloodline:</b> The capricious nature of the fey runs in your family due to some intermingling of fey blood or magic. You are more emotional than most, prone to bouts of joy and rage.\n"
"<b>Undead Bloodline:</b> The taint of the grave runs through your family. Perhaps one of your ancestors became a powerful lich or vampire, or maybe you were born dead before suddenly returning to life. Either way, the forces of death move through you and touch your every action.\n"
"<b>Draconic Bloodlines</b>\n"
"At some point in your family's history, a dragon interbred with your bloodline, and now its ancient power flows through your veins.\n"
"<b>Black Dragon – Acid:</b> Lording over the darkest swamps and marshes, black dragons are the undisputed masters of their domain, ruling through cruelty and intimidation. Those who dwell within a black dragon's reach live in fear.\n"
"<b>Blue Dragon – Electricity:</b> Blue dragons are consummate schemers and obsessively orderly. In combat, blue dragons prefer to surprise foes if possible, and are not above retreating if the odds turn against them.\n"
"<b>Brass Dragon – Fire:</b> Consummate conversationalists, brass dragons prefer to talk instead of fight.\n"
"<b>Bronze Dragon – Electricity:</b> Bronze dragons have been known to ally with travelers and adventurers if the cause and reward is right and just.\n"
"<b>Copper Dragon – Acid:</b> Copper dragons are whimsical and spend most of their time in combat trying to annoy and frustrate their enemies.\n"
"<b>Gold Dragon – Fire:</b> Gold dragons are the epitome of virtue. Other metallic dragons revere their gold cousins as the agents of divine forces and the paragons of dragonkind, and often seek them for advice or aid.\n"
"<b>Green Dragon – Acid:</b> Green dragons dwell in the ancient forests of the world, prowling under towering canopies in search of prey. Of all the chromatic dragons, green dragons are perhaps the easiest to deal with diplomatically.\n"
"<b>Red Dragon – Fire:</b> Few creatures are more cruel and fearsome than the mighty red dragon. King of the chromatics, this terrible beast brings ruin and death to the lands that fall under its shadow.\n"
"<b>Silver Dragon – Cold:</b> Of all the dragons, silvers are the most courageous, holding themselves to a chivalrous code to help the weak, defeat evil, and behave in an honorable manner.\n"
"<b>White Dragon – Cold:</b> Although most consider it to be the weakest and most feral of the chromatic dragons, the white dragon makes up for its lack of cunning with sheer ferocity.\n"
"<b>Bonus Feats of Draconic Bloodline:</b>\n"
"<b>Blind-Fight</b>\n"
"In melee, every time you miss because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit.\n"
"An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however.\n"
"<b>Great Fortitude</b>\n"
"You get a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saving throws.\n"
"Improved Initiative\n"
"Your quick reflexes allow you to react rapidly to danger. You get a +4 bonus on initiative checks.\n"
"<b>Power Attack</b>\n"
"You can choose to take a –1 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +2 bonus on all melee damage rolls. This bonus to damage is increased by half (+50%) if you are making an attack with a two-handed weapon, a one handed weapon using two hands, or a primary natural weapon that adds 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier on damage rolls. This bonus to damage is halved (–50%) if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or secondary natural weapon.\n"
"When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every 4 points thereafter, the penalty increases by –1 and the bonus to damage increases by +2.\n"
"You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.\n"
"<b>Metamagic (Quicken)</b>\n"
"You can cast spells in a fraction of the normal time.\n"
"Benefit: Casting a quickened spell is a swift action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 round or 1 full-round action cannot be quickened.\n"
"Level Increase: +4 (a quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level.)\n"
"Casting a quickened spell doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.\n"
"Special: You can apply the effects of this feat to a spell cast spontaneously, so long as it has a casting time that is not more than 1 full-round action, without increasing the spell's casting time.\n"
"<b>Skill Focus (Mobility)</b>\n"
"You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving Mobility. If you have 10 or more ranks in Mobility, this bonus increases to +6.\n"
"<b>Skill Focus (Knowledge Arcana)</b>\n"
"You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving Knowledge Arcana. If you have 10 or more ranks in Knowledge Arcana, this bonus increases to +6.\n"
"<b>Toughness</b>\n"
"You gain +3 hit points. For every Hit Die you possess beyond 3, you gain an additional +1 hit point. If you have more than 3 Hit Dice, you gain +1 hit points whenever you gain a Hit Die (such as when you gain a level)."

Armor never affects a spell-like ability's use, even if the ability resembles an arcane spell with a somatic component.\n"

"If a character class grants a spell-like ability that is not based on an actual spell, the ability's effective spell level is equal to the highest-level class spell the character can cast, and is cast at the class level the ability is gained."

"Drawn from the ranks of guards, knights, mercenaries, and thugs alike, stalwart defenders are masters of claiming an area and refusing to relinquish it. This behavior is more than a tactical decision for stalwart defenders; it's an obsessive, stubborn expression of the need to be undefeated. When stalwart defenders set themselves in a defensive stance, they place their whole effort into weathering whatever foe, conflict, or threat comes their way.\n"
"Most stalwart defenders come from the ranks of fighters, often those desiring to be better guards for friends and allies. <link=\"Encyclopedia:Dwarves\"><b>Dwarves</b></link> are particularly suited to the role, though stalwart defenders of all races exist. More rarely, barbarians take the path of the stalwart defender as a matter of pride, to overcome some perceived shortcoming. Such characters often seem to suffer from dual personalities, flinging themselves recklessly into combat one moment, then calmly fending off all attackers the next.\n"
"Stalwart defenders are masters of melee combat, striving to prove that the best offense is a good defense. Stalwart defenders are normally found on the front lines of battle, holding a position to cover their allies, leaping into breaches of opposing formations and holding them open for others, and guarding more vulnerable allies by acting as mobile fortifications, stable points in the ever-changing chaos of battle.\n"
"<b>Class Details</b>\n"
"<b><link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\">Alignment</link>:</b> Anyone can be as stubborn as a rock and dedicated to holding one point no matter the cost, so stalwart defenders can be of any alignment. The dedication and practice required to learn the talents of a stalwart defender come more easily to characters with a strong respect for order and organization, however, so lawful stalwart defenders are much more common than chaotic ones.\n"
"<b>Hit Die:</b> d12.\n"
"<b>Requirements</b>\n"
"To qualify to become a stalwart defender, a character must fulfill all the following criteria:\n"
"<b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> +7\n"
"<b>Feats:</b> Dodge, Endurance, Toughness\n"
"<b>Special:</b> Proficiency with light and medium armor\n"
"<b>Class Skills</b>\n"
"The stalwart defender's class skills are Athletics, Mobility, Persuasion and Perception.\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Defensive Stance</b>\n"
"At 1st level, a stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance, a position of readiness and trance-like determination. A stalwart defender can maintain this stance for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his <link=\"Encyclopedia:Constitution\"><b>Constitution</b></link> modifier. At each level after 1st, he can maintain the stance for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from the defensive stance and spells like bear's endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that the stalwart defender can maintain a defensive stance per day. The stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance as a free action. The total number of rounds of defensive stance per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender gains a +2 bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saving throws. In addition, she gains a 2 dodge bonus to Armor Class and 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die. While in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender cannot willingly move from his current position through any means (including normal movement, riding a mount, teleportation, or willingly allowing allies to carry him). If he enters a defensive stance while on a moving vehicle he does not control (such as a wagon or ship), he can maintain the stance even if the vehicle moves. If the stalwart defender moves under his own power as a result of an enchantment spell, his stance ends.\n"
"The stalwart defender can end his defensive stance as a free action; after ending the stance, he is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the stance. A stalwart defender cannot enter a new defensive stance while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter a stance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a stalwart defender falls unconscious, his defensive stance immediately ends, placing him in peril of death. A defensive stance requires a level of emotional calm, and it may not be maintained by a character in a rage (such as from the rage class feature or the rage spell).\n"
"<b>Uncanny Dodge</b>\n"
"The character can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A character with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.\n"
"<b>Improved Uncanny Dodge</b>\n"
"A character can no longer be flanked.\n"
"This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.\n"
"<b>Defensive power</b>\n"
"As a stalwart defender gains levels, he augments his defensive stance. Starting at 2nd level, the stalwart defender gains a defensive power. He gains another defensive power for every two levels of stalwart defender attained after 2nd level. The stalwart defender gains the benefits of defensive powers only while in a defensive stance, and some of these powers require him to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, he cannot select an individual power more than once.\n"
"<b>Selectable Features</b>\n"
"<b>Defensive powers:</b>\n"
"<b>Fearless Defense</b>\n"
"While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender is immune to the shaken and frightened conditions. He must be at least 4th level before selecting this power.\n"
"<b>Increased Damage Reduction</b>\n"
"The stalwart defender's damage reduction from this class increases by 1/—. This increase is always active while the stalwart defender is in a defensive stance. He can select this power up to two times. Its effects stack. The stalwart defender must be at least 6th level before selecting this defensive power.\n"
"<b>Renewed Defense</b>\n"
"As a standard action, the stalwart defender heals 1d8 points of damage + his Constitution modifier. For every two levels the stalwart defender has attained above 2nd, this healing increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 5d8 at 10th level. This power can be used only once per day and only while in a defensive stance.\n"
"<b>Roused defense</b>\n"
"The stalwart defender may enter a defensive stance even if fatigued. While maintaining a defensive stance after using this ability, he is immune to the fatigued condition. Once this stance ends, he is exhausted for 10 minutes per round spent in a defensive stance.\n"
"<b>Smash</b>\n"
"While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender may make an extra attack per round that is either a slam (even if he doesn't normally have a slam attack). If used as part of a full attack action, the extra attack is made at the stalwart defender's full base attack bonus –5. The smash deals 1d4 points of damage (if the stalwart defender is Medium, or 1d3 if he is Small) plus half the character's Strength modifier."

When taking an attack action, you can apply all appropriate options that modify an attack action.

You can't combine options that modify attack actions with standard actions that aren't attack actions, such as Cleave.\n"
"<b>Melee Attack:</b> While a melee attack isn't an action type itself, many options and other rules affect melee attacks. Some combat options can be used anytime you make a melee attack, including attacks of opportunity. These options can't be combined with each other, but they can be combined with options that modify an attack action or are standard or full-round actions."

"Tatzlwyrms are thought to be primeval relatives of true dragons, having branched off the line millennia ago and evolved in a way that sets them notably apart. Undersized compared to their larger cousins, tatzlwyrms are nonetheless ferocious in their own right. And while tatzlwyrms are hardly impressive specimens when put beside their notorious relatives, most other reptiles can't compare to them mentally. They understand Draconic, though other languages are beyond most tatzlwyrms' limited comprehension. Nevertheless, tatzlwyrms are deeply cunning, building complex lairs and rudimentary traps.\n"
"Tatzlwyrms are quite rare, and only a few particularly curious and lucky adventurers can claim to have seen a living specimen. Reports do agree on some basic features, however. About the size of a full-grown human, tatzlwyrms have only two limbs and no wings, and possess a weak poisonous breath similar to the breath weapons of their true dragon relatives. An adult tatzlwyrm is 6 to 8 feet long, including its winding, organless tail, and it weighs between 400 and 500 pounds. A tatzlwyrm's scales give the creature limited camouflage, ranging through various shades of green, brown, and gray.\n"
"Like true dragons, tatzlwyrms are strict carnivores. They spend most of their time hiding, waiting to attack any prey that ventures too near. They consume their food slowly in the dark security and seclusion of their lairs. Tatzlwyrms have a remarkable knack for ambush and camouflage."

"Simultaneously more and less than mortal, tieflings are the offspring of humans and fiends. With otherworldly blood and traits to match, tieflings are often shunned and despised out of reactionary fear. Most tieflings never know their fiendish sire, as the coupling that produced their curse occurred generations earlier. The taint is long-lasting and persistent, often manifesting at birth or sometimes later in life, as a powerful, though often unwanted, boon. Despite their fiendish appearance and netherworld origins, tieflings have a human's capacity of choosing their fate, and while many embrace their dark heritage and side with fiendish powers, others reject their darker predilections. Though the power of their blood calls nearly every tiefling to fury, destruction, and wrath, even the spawn of a succubus can become a saint and the grandchild of a pit fiend an unsuspecting hero.\n"
"<b>Physical Description:</b>\n"
"No two tieflings look alike; the fiendish blood running through their veins manifests inconsistently, granting them an array of fiendish traits. One tiefling might appear as a human with small horns, a barbed tail, and oddly colored eyes, while another might manifest a mouth of fangs, tiny wings, and claws, and yet another might possess the perpetual smell of blood, foul incenses, and brimstone. Typically, these qualities hearken back in some way to the manner of fiend that spawned the tiefling's bloodline, but even then the admixture of human and fiendish blood is rarely ruled by sane, mortal laws, and the vast flexibility it produces in tieflings is a thing of wonder, running the gamut from oddly beautiful to utterly terrible.\n"
"<b>Society:</b>\n"
"Tieflings on the Material Plane rarely create their own settlements and holdings. Instead, they live on the fringes of the land where they were born or choose to settle. Most societies view tieflings as aberrations or curses, but in cultures where there are frequent interactions with summoned fiends, and especially where the worship of demons, devils, or other evil outsiders is legal or obligatory, tieflings might be much more populous and accepted, even cherished as blessings of their fiendish overlords. Tieflings seldom see another of their own kind, and thus they usually simply adopt the culture and mannerisms of their human parents. On other planes, tieflings form enclaves of their own kind. But often such enclaves are less than harmonious — the diversity of tiefling forms and philosophies is an inherent source of conflict between members of the race, and cliques and factions constantly form in an ever-shifting hierarchy where only the most opportunistic or devious gain advantage. Only those of common bloodlines or those who manage to divorce their worldview from the inherently selfish, devious, and evil nature of their birth manage to find true acceptance, camaraderie, and common ground among others of their kind.\n"
"<b>Relations:</b>\n"
"Tieflings face a significant amount of prejudice from most other races, who view them as fiend-spawn, seeds of evil, monsters, and lingering curses placed upon the world. Far too often, civilized races shun or marginalize them, while more monstrous ones simply fear and reject them unless forced or cowed into acceptance. But <link=\"Encyclopedia:Half-elves\"><b>half-elves</b></link>, <link=\"Encyclopedia:Half-orcs\"><b>half-orcs</b></link>, fetchlings and — most oddly — aasimars tend to view them as kindred spirits who are too often rejected or who don't fit into most societies by virtue of their birth. The widespread assumption that tieflings are innately evil — ill-founded though it may be — prevents many from easily fitting into most cultures on the Material Plane except in exceedingly cosmopolitan or planar-influenced nations.\n"
"<b>Alignment and Religion:</b>\n"
"Despite their fiendish heritage and the insidious influence of prejudice, tieflings can be of any <link=\"Encyclopedia:Alignment\"><b>alignment</b></link>. Many of them fall prey to the dark desires that haunt their psyches, and give in to the seduction of the whispering evil within, yet others steadfastly reject their origins and actively fight against evil lures and the negative assumptions they face from others by performing acts of good. Most, however, strive to simply find their own way in the world, though they tend to adopt a very amoral, neutral view when they do. Though many creatures just assume that tieflings worship devils and demons, their religious views are as varied as their physical forms. Individual tieflings worship all manner of deities, but they are just as likely to shun religion all together. Those who give in to the dark whispers that haunt the psyche of all tieflings serve all manner of powerful fiends.\n"
"<b>Adventurers:</b>\n"
"Tieflings rarely integrate into the mortal societies they call home. Drawn to the adventuring life as a method of escape, they hope to make a better life for themselves, to prove their freedom from their blood's taint, or to punish a world that fears and rejects them. Tieflings make skilled rogues, powerful wizards and magi, and especially puissant sorcerers as their potent blood empowers them. Those who succumb to the evil within often become powerful clerics of fiendish powers.\n"
"<b>Standard Racial Traits</b>\n"
"<b><link=\"Encyclopedia:Ability_Scores\">Ability Score</link>Ability Score</b> Racial Traits: Tieflings are quick in body and mind, but are inherently strange and unnerving.

"Torag loves the dwarven race, and has come to love his non-dwarven worshipers, but withholds most direct aid and affection from both, for he sees life as a hard journey, and if he sheltered his children from all hardship, they would not know the value of their own hard work or the satisfaction of their achievements. He created the dwarves to be tough, stubborn, wise, and creative — traits they would need to persevere and overcome all obstacles — and expects all his worshipers of all races and walks of life to seek to embody those traits. He opposes those who act without thinking, rebel, or place their community at risk.\n"
"As god of the forge, the Father of Creation concerns himself with the art of creating and shaping metal. He believes that shoddy workmanship insults not only the crafter and the wielder of a tool or weapon, but the item itself, and pushes his followers to continually refine and improve their craft. A devout worshiper makes weapons that don't fail in battle and tools than don't wear quickly under heavy use. Torag opposes the destruction of well-crafted things, and frowns on burying armor and weapons with the dead, as these items can help protect a vulnerable community or bring needed coin to an impoverished one.\n"
"Torag is a shrewd planner, a great advocate of contingencies, and he holds forethought as one of the principal gifts of living well. However, he knows there are times when a dwarf needs to abandon a failing strategy and think on her feet, so Torag respects officers, soldiers, and wardens who demonstrate this quality. He prefers organized defenses to tactical assaults, and tactical assaults over reckless charges. He does not believe there is glory in martyrdom, but honors those who sacrifice their own lives to save others. He is a stout fighter, rarely given to rage, but when his anger awakens, the earth shakes and cities fall.\n"
"When Torag appears to his worshipers, he's an older but hearty dwarf clad in heavy plate armor, with eyes glowing like molten gold. His hair and beard may be any common dwarven hair color, often with streaks of gray, and his hands are worn and scarred from centuries of hard work. He exudes a palpable aura of power, wisdom, and safety. In art, he's always depicted in intricate armor, and typically shown busy at his forge hammering out a weapon or shield. Some images depict him as a mighty guardian, shielding dwarven children with his body as he clears away orcs and trolls with mighty sweeps of his warhammer Kaglemros.\n"
"Torag shows his approval through reflections of his face on polished metal, preparations happening smoothly and ahead of schedule, excellence at the forge, and the discovery of mushrooms or stone fragments that match the shape of his hammer. He sometimes sends messages as cryptic riddles that appear on stone surfaces for a short period of time. When angered, forges grow cold, shields crack, and even the simplest plan carries a feeling of impending doom. Earthquakes (whether localized or expansive) are the ultimate indication of his displeasure, yet those who survive a deadly quake are considered blessed. His holy symbol is his warhammer. He is called the Father of Creation, the Father of Dwarvenkind, and the Forgefather.\n"

"<b>Polymorph</b>\n"
"A polymorph spell transforms your physical body to take on the shape of another creature. Each polymorph spell allows you to assume the form of a creature of a specific type, granting you a number of bonuses to your ability scores and a bonus to your natural armor. In addition, each polymorph spell can grant you a number of other benefits, including movement types, resistances, and senses. If the form you choose grants these benefits, or a greater ability of the same type, you gain the listed benefit. If the form grants a lesser ability of the same type, you gain the lesser ability instead. Your base speed changes to match that of the form you assume. The DC for any of these abilities equals your DC for the polymorph spell used to change you into that form.\n"
"In addition to these benefits, you gain any of the natural attacks of the base creature, including proficiency in those attacks. These attacks are based on your base attack bonus, modified by your <link=\"Encyclopedia:Strength\">Strength</link> or <link=\"Encyclopedia:Dexterity\">Dexterity</link> as appropriate, and use your Strength modifier for determining damage bonuses.\n"
"If a polymorph spell causes you to change size, apply the size modifiers appropriately, changing your armor class, attack bonus, <link=\"Encyclopedia:CMB\">Combat Maneuver Bonus</link>, and <link=\"Encyclopedia:Stealth\">Stealth</link> skill modifiers. Your ability scores are not modified by this change unless noted by the spell.\n"
"Unless otherwise noted, polymorph spells cannot be used to change into specific individuals. Although many of the fine details can be controlled, your appearance is always that of a generic member of that creature's type.\n"
"When you cast a polymorph spell that changes you into a creature of the animal, dragon, elemental, magical beast, plant, or vermin type, all of your gear melds into your body. Items that provide constant bonuses and do not need to be activated continue to function while melded in this way (with the exception of armor and shield bonuses, which cease to function). Items that require activation cannot be used while you maintain that form. While in such a form, you cannot cast any spells that require material components, and can only cast spells with somatic or verbal components if the form you choose has the capability to make such movements or speak, such as a dragon. If your new form does not cause your equipment to meld into your form, the equipment resizes to match your new <link=\"Encyclopedia:Size\">size</link>.\n"
"While under the effects of a polymorph spell, you lose all extraordinary and supernatural abilities that depend on your original form (such as keen senses, scent, and darkvision), as well as any natural attacks and movement types possessed by your original form. You also lose any class features that depend upon form, but those that allow you to add features (such as sorcerers that can grow claws) still function. Your new form might restore a number of these abilities if they are possessed by the new form.\n"
"You can only be affected by one polymorph spell at a time. If a new polymorph spell is cast on you (or you activate a polymorph effect, such as wild shape), you can decide whether or not to allow it to affect you, taking the place of the old spell. In addition, other spells that change your size have no effect on you while you are under the effects of a polymorph spell."

"Treants are guardians of the forest and speakers for the trees. As long-lived as the forests themselves, and seeing themselves as parents and shepherds rather than gardeners, treants are slow and methodical in most things but terrifying when forced to fight in defense of their flock. Though they rarely seek out the companionship of the short-lived races, and have an inherent distrust of change, they have been known to tolerate those who seek to learn from their long, rambling monologues, especially if the pupils express a desire to help protect the wildlands. Yet against those who would threaten the forest, especially loggers who seek to harvest wood for lumber or those who try to clearcut a section of forest in order to build a fort or establish a town, the treants' wrath is swift and devastating. They are particularly gifted at tearing down what others build — a trait that serves angry treants well.\n"
"Treants are primarily solitary creatures, with a given individual sometimes responsible for an entire forest, but they occasionally come together in small groups called groves to share news and reproduce. In times of grave danger, all of the groves in a region may gather for a great months-long meeting called a moot, but such events are exceedingly rare, and millennia may go by between them.\n"

"Slavering and voracious, trollhounds seem to be trolls in smaller canine form, and indeed, are often found as pets among gangs and tribes of <link=\"Encyclopedia:Trolls\"><b>trolls</b></link>. Requiring vast amounts of food to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild trollhounds range far and wide through the mountains of the north, their ravenous hunger driving them to hunt and consume any prey they can track down and kill.\n"
"A typical trollhound stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder, has short but powerful legs, and weighs around 350 pounds. A trollhound's skin is somewhat scaly, with patches of rough, greenish-black fur. It has oversized jaws with a pronounced underbite, and its eyes are normally a dull, hateful orange.\n"
"Trollhounds are believed to be the outcome of infusing particularly ferocious worgs with alchemically prepared troll blood. The resulting beast loses the worg's wicked intelligence but gains the ability to regenerate even the most grievous wounds, except those inf licted by fire or acid. Whatever their origin, trollhounds breed true and are often raised by trolls.\n"
"Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of fire is enough to repel them, as the beasts are too dull to recognize the danger it poses. Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds, and canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a slain trollhound, for as is true of trolls, even the smallest piece of trollhound flesh can eventually regrow back into a full-sized beast.\n"
"Trollhounds are most often found in the company of trolls, who breed the beasts as hunters, guards, pets, and food. Trollhounds seem to have an affinity for their savage masters, and tamed trollhounds always regard trolls as alpha members of the pack. A trollhound will never attack a troll without cause — although trolls often enjoy violent roughhousing with these creatures nonetheless."

"Trolls possess incredibly sharp claws and amazing regenerative powers, allowing them to recover from nearly any wound. They are stooped, fantastically ugly, and astonishingly strong — combined with their claws, their strength allows them to literally tear apart flesh to feed their voracious appetites. Trolls stand about 14 feet tall, but their hunched postures often make them appear shorter. An adult troll weighs around 1,000 pounds.\n"
"A troll's appetite and its regenerative powers make it a fearless combatant, ever prepared to charge headlong at the nearest living creature and attack with all of its fury. Only fire and acid seem to cause a troll to hesitate, but even this mortal threat is not enough to stop a troll's advance.\n"
"Despite their cruelty in combat, trolls are surprisingly tender and kind to their own young. Female trolls work as a group, spending a great deal of time teaching young trolls to hunt and fend for themselves before sending them off to find their own territories. A male troll tends to live a solitary existence, partnering with a female for only a brief time to mate. All trolls spend most of their time hunting for food, as they must consume vast amounts each day or face starvation.\n"
"Due to this need, most trolls stake out large territories as their own, and fights between rivals are quite common. While these are usually nonlethal, trolls are aware of each others' weaknesses and will use such knowledge to kill their own kind if food is scarce."

This bond generally ends amiably if the woman becomes more committed to someone else — such as a lover or child — giving rise to the myth that unicorns only befriend virgins.\n"

"Urgathoa is an utterly amoral, hedonistic goddess, concerned only with satiating her own desires regardless of the consequences others suffer. Like Desna, she strives for experience and a full appreciation of the world — but her appreciation is utterly selfish. She was once a mortal woman with a tremendous appetite for life, one who rebelled against the notion of being judged by Pharasma and losing the joys of living. Somehow in death she found the strength to tear herself from Pharasma's endless line of souls and return to Golarion, becoming a divine being and the world's first undead creature. Her existence is a corruption of the natural order; some say her first divine footprints upon the soil of the Material Plane birthed plague and infection, and that the first shadows and wraiths were born of her breath.\n"
"The goddess's half-rotted form limits the sensations she can experience, so she makes up for this lack with gluttonous depravity — she's tasted the brains of human infants to savor their innocence, torn the heart from the last living member of a race just to feel the sensation of its hot blood on her hands, and inflicted boils and leprosy upon handsome princes just to see the unique patterns they form on royal flesh. To her, the dull existence of a dead soul is pointless and tedious compared to the vibrant intensity of mortal or undead sensation, and creatures should cram as much sensation into existence as possible. Asceticism is repugnant to her, and she particularly loathes those who follow the strict taboos of the Prophecies of Kalistrade.\n"
"Urgathoa is usually depicted as a beautiful, raven-haired woman from the waist up — much like her mortal self, though she's as pale as a hungry vampire. Her lower half is rotted and withered, decaying farther down until only blood-covered bones remain at her feet. When she walks, she leaves bloody, skeletal footprints. Although she sometimes manifests nude in the faithful's visions, she usually appears wearing a sheer red or black gown. From neck to toe, the gown is stained with hideous patches of black, brown, and red. On rare occasions, she assumes a monstrous shape similar to those of the hideous undead creatures known as daughters of Urgathoa, with one huge arm covered in fanged mouths and a tail made of multiple fused spinal columns.\n"
"Urgathoa's realm in the Great Beyond is a cluster of cities in a wasteland part of Abaddon, filled with undead residents indulging all of their mortal vices in great excess. The daemons of that realm observe Urgathoa and her followers, but leave them alone and untouched — the main threat to her realm is attacks from Pharasma's minions, who intend to repatriate undead souls to the Boneyard and restore them to their proper destination in the afterlife.\n"
"Though the Pallid Princess's church is interested primarily in undeath, some cults focus on her gluttonous aspect, indulging in decadent feasts of food, alcohol, and drugs, as well as lavish orgies. Unfortunately, in many cases these \"dilettante\" cults decline into more depraved practices, eventually embracing necromantic profanities and conversion to ghouls, vampires, and similar creatures.\n"
"When Urgathoa is pleased, common food tastes delicious, water turns to fine wine, and meals are never so filling that the diner feels uncomfortable. There are also stories of starving worshipers unexpectedly finding injured or freshly killed meat (in some stories, the meat is humanoid). She rarely uses animals as messengers, but sometimes sends a death's head moth to lead a devout worshiper to a reward, or clouds of biting flies to warn away or punish a mortal. Female clerics who serve her particularly well may be transformed into daughters of Urgathoa. When she's angry, food and water taste like ash and fill the belly with gnawing hunger that cannot be sated, and the target of her ire may be afflicted with rotting or swelling diseases that make it difficult to eat or speak. She has been known to paralyze an offender's legs so the victim must crawl, or reverse the taste of his food so that garbage and sewage are the only things he can bear to swallow. The afflicted can alleviate the condition by making a large sacrifice to Urgathoa, either at a temple or by providing some gluttonous feast, drug experience, or other orgiastic excess in her name. On rare occasions, the only way to alleviate the curse is by willingly engaging in cannibalism, an act that taints the offender's soul and all but guarantees eternal allegiance to the Pallid Princess.\n"
"Urgathoa's holy symbol is a death's head moth, often drawn so the skull-markings are exaggerated, or even depicted as a skull with a moth's wings, legs, and head.\n"

"A vilderavn is a malicious shapechanging spirit whose typical form is that of an oversized raven with a wingspan of 6 to 8 feet that stands 2 to 3 feet tall. Vilderavns sometimes roam in the shape of <link=\"Encyclopedia:Wolf\"><b>wolves</b></link> or dire wolves, and are known to appear as monstrous raven-wolf hybrids akin to black-feathered perytons. They can also walk in humanoid guise when they wish, often assassinating victims of rank and assuming their victims' places. They have an unusual affection for their swords, often granting them threatening names.\n"
"Vilderavns are drawn to war and suffering, often haunting battlefields — especially during protracted sieges. They are particularly drawn toward rulers and commanders, and might insinuate themselves into the confidence of leaders with their clever tongues and deft rumor-mongering. They are deceivers and heralds of woe, seeking to lure the rulers of mortal kingdoms into jealous feuds and fruitless wars with one another. To do this, they often cultivate reputations as master duelists, brilliant mercenary leaders, or unjustly banished nobility from distant lands. Regardless of their guises, vilderavns' advice usually seems wise and perceptive, steeped in an expansive knowledge of history, political rivalries, and cultural clashes, along with insights into the ways of war. Yet while their counsel might lead to early victories, their ultimate purpose is to bring doom to all sides. At the height of the battle, when victory seems nigh, a vilderavn often instigates a wave of betrayal, crippling erstwhile allies and bringing devastation.\n"
"Only when a ruler's kingdom or a commander's army lies in ruins does a vilderavn administer the coup de grace.\n"
"It is said that the first vilderavns were created by a vicious fey lord as a check and counter to the hubris of mortal rulers, especially those who put their trust in armies and steel to drive back the wildlands. The boasting and braggadocio of those mortals who believed they had achieved mastery over the followers of the old ways offended the fey lord, who sent vilderavns to infiltrate their ranks. The vilderavns watched from the shadows and learned the ways of mortals, the better to use their own weapons and strategies against them. In torment and blood, they peeled away the secrets of mortals, laying the last truths of their hearts bare before bestowing the gift of death on them. Even in death, however, a vilderavn's victims languish, stretched across the threshold of the afterlife yet tethered to the fey spirit's merciless heart. Their minds are open books for this fey to unravel and use in cruel and hurtful ways.\n"
"Vilderavns sometimes amuse themselves by offering false oracular advice or tempting bargains to mortals, promising power in exchange for the blood of innocents. A vilderavn typically claims to be cursed into its animal form, insisting that only innocent blood will release it. If its mark is foolish enough to accept its bargain, the vilderavn often returns wearing the innocent's flesh to torment its supposed ally and drive her to insanity. A vilderavn might even offer an irony-laced limited wish to sweeten its bargains and truly test a mortal's resolve."

"Whether born naturally or afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy, wererats are lycanthropes who can switch between human and rat form and are common in crowded and dirty cities. They are one of the two most common forms of lycanthrope (the other is the werewolf) and one of the most feared. They are also among the physically weakest, so rely on stealth and cunning to survive.\n"
"Like all lycanthropes, wererats have multiple forms, the most mundane forms they take are either as regular humans or rats. Whilst an infected wererat human form looks like they did before they were cursed (although sometimes taking on rat-like mannerisms) natural wererats tend to be short and wiry, often with a nervous disposition and darting rodent-like eyes. Wererats can also take on a hybrid from which combines their humanoid form with rat features. In this form they gain a long, twitchy tail, fur covers their whole body and their head becomes that of a rat giving them a nasty bite.\n"
"Wererats almost always dwell in cities for it is there where rats and humans most commonly co-habit and so it is where a wererat can most easily blend in. Many cities have wererat infestations from lawless slums like Riddleport to well-run cities like Korvosa. Because of their ability to blend in as rats and the mobility this grants them, wererats often find work in a thieves' guild."

"Whether born naturally or afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy, weretigers are lycanthropes who can switch between humanoid and tiger form. They are one of the most feared types of lycanthrope.\n"
"Like all lycanthropes, weretigers have three forms — a humanoid form, a tiger form and a hybrid form. A weretiger in tiger form looks like a normal animal, although often a particularly strong and tough specimen. Perceptive observers may also spot the creature has more than animal intelligence. Afflicted weretigers in humanoid form keep their previous appearance (although they often take on a tiger-like grace). Natural weretigers tend have large eyes, long noses and sharp cheekbones, and tend towards brown or red hair. Weretigers can also take on a hybrid form which combines their humanoid form with tiger-like features. In this form they gain a tail, striped fur and a feline face complete with sharp teeth.\n"
"Weretigers are generally solitary in nature, coming together only to breed. They enjoy the thrill of the hunt, and those of an evil disposition find that intelligent prey provides the biggest thrill of all.\n"
"Most weretigers believe they have a divine right to rule over lesser \"prey\" creatures, and seek to care out as large a domain as possible. They brook no rivals, and as a result natural weretigers are most commonly found alone, or sometimes as a mated pair. Larger groups are extremely rare. Natural weretigers might create afflicted weretigers to serve as henchmen, only to dispose of them once they have served their purpose."

"In their humanoid form, werewolves look like normal people, though some tend to look a bit feral and have wild hair. Eyebrows that grow together, index fingers longer than the middle fingers, and strange birthmarks on the palm of the hand are all commonly accepted indications that a person is in fact a werewolf. Of course, such telltale signs are not always accurate, for such physical traits exist in normal people as well, but in areas where werewolves are a common problem, the traits can be damning regardless.\n"
"Of all the various types of lycanthropes, it is the werewolf that is the most widespread and the most feared. Stories of werewolves haunting lonely forest roads, prowling misty moors on the outskirts of rural societies, or dwelling in the shadows of the largest cities are widespread as well. In most societies, werewolves are feared and despised — and with good reason, as the typical werewolf personifies all that is savage and bestial in a lycanthrope. This isn't to say that good-aligned werewolves are unknown, but they're certainly a minority among their kind, and most werewolves are evil murderers who delight in the hunt and the succulent taste of raw meat.\n"
"Just as wolves are pack animals, werewolves have been known to gather in colonies and live among their own kind, humanoid by day and beast at night. Visitors to werewolf villages are generally rushed out of town before nightfall so as not to discover the citizenry's dark secret — unless, of course, the pack decides that the unlucky visitor won't be missed by friends back home."

"The wild hunt is an awe-inspiring and enigmatic group of fey who stalk and pursue their chosen prey between worlds. Those few who have caught glimpses of these elusive beings and lived to tell the tale speak of clouds of green mist filled with spectral hounds, archers who fire bolts of magic with inhuman accuracy, and the sound of a melodious horn echoing for miles across the landscape.\n"
"Although some believe the wild hunt is nothing more than a mere legend, or perhaps groups of vengeful spirits that hunt the living, the riders of the wild hunt are real, and are powerful fey indeed. Countless members of these fey compose the wild hunt — the term \"wild hunt\" refers to the race as a whole as well as to individual groups of these fey who gather to pursue their quarry.\n"
"All fey of the wild hunt ultimately serve a legendary leader they refer to only as the Horned King. The Horned King's nature is unknown, but its ability to command such powerful followers suggests that it is a fey lord with the power of a demigod — or perhaps even that of a true deity. When the Horned King calls, several wild hunts join into a legion and ride together against legendary opponents.\n"
"Because of their occasional role as the agents of a reclusive fey divinity, the members of the wild hunt are sometimes classified among powerful entities known collectively as the Tane. In support of this theory, wild hunt fey share the Tane's ability to instantly acclimate themselves to a new plane. However, the relationship between wild hunts and the Tane is more complex, as the Tane can sometimes become targets of a wild hunt, and on other occasions, wild hunt masters strike bargains to gain the temporary assistance of one of the Tane.\n"
"The Horned King's call is rare, however, and wild hunts are normally left to direct themselves. Each wild hunt follows a wild hunt monarch, who travels effortlessly between the realm of the fey and the Material Plane in search of new quarry. While most missions come from rumors gathered by the wild hunt monarch, they occasionally consider proposals from those rare few brave and knowledgeable enough to seek them out. They accept tasks only from worthy sources, and the payments they demand for their services vary significantly, though they have no interest in material wealth. Wild hunt monarchs take grave offense at unfavorable deals. Those who attempt to cheat a wild hunt monarch or involve one in trivial matters often become the enraged fey's next target.\n"
"Members of the wild hunt usually hail from the fey's primal homeland, but they frequently venture to the Material Plane to pursue their quarry. Reasons for individual wild hunts vary, ranging from tests or demonstrations of skill to missions of vengeance and even drives to improve a wild hunt's own numbers.\n"
"When they hunt for the thrill of the chase, they choose difficult quarry or intentionally place convoluted restrictions upon themselves to increase the challenge of the task. They try to avoid killing their targets, at least at first, but if their quarry refuses to understand that the purpose of the exercise is a battle of wits and responds with particularly lethal tactics, they reply in kind. After all, if a mortal is too foolish to recognize a friendly competition, it is his own ignorance that is to blame for his death, rather than the actions of a wild hunt.\n"
"At other times, a wild hunt fights to kill its prey. In this role, its members act as assassins. If they expect that their prey has means to revive itself, they may transport the remains to another plane before turning the corpse into dust. Should their foes return to life anyway, the wild hunt fey's reaction is unpredictable, ranging from amused detachment to furious bloodlust. Foes that the wild hunt chases for a second time face a far more ignoble fate than death. For example, some wild hunt monarchs keep a small menagerie of animals made from their most irritating prey. Others simply disappear without a trace, seemingly beyond the reach of resurrection magic.\n"
"The rarest reason a wild hunt rides is to seek new hunters for its ranks. Although most members of the wild hunt originate from the realm of the fey, a scant few trace their origins back to the fateful day when they failed to escape a wild hunt's interest. A wild hunt's reasons for seeking out any particular mortal are shrouded in mystery, though wild hunts seldom pursue mortals who lack significant strength or power. After a lengthy pursuit, a wild hunt's monarch ritually slays the quarry, which reincarnates the following morning as a new member of the hunt. When mortals join the wild hunt, memories from their previous lives fade away, though they sometimes retain a measure of personality. If the wild hunt master finds the mortal's talents or skills particularly impressive, he may choose to preserve these abilities, transforming the mortal into a unique member of the hunt. These specialized hunters retain most of their memories as well. While they occasionally spend time with their old friends and family, the call of the hunt master's horn is far stronger than any loyalty they felt in their previous lives, making the maintenance of old relationships a fraught endeavor.\n"
"The fey of the wild hunt consist of three distinct races. While these types of fey can be encountered alone or in small groups, they are at their most dangerous when banded together into a true wild hunt. This gathering of fey consists of a wild hunt monarch, wild hunt scout, and wild hunt archers."

"Every trapper and bog farmer living near marshes or swamps has his own name for these faintly glowing balls of light — jack o' the lanterns, corpse candles, walking fires, pine lights, spooklights, rushlights — but all recognize them as dangerous predators and false guides in the darkness.\n"
"Evil creatures that feed on the strong psychic emanations of terrified creatures, will-o'-wisps delight in tempting gullible travelers into dangerous situations. In the wild lands where they're most common, will-o'-wisps favor simple tactics like positioning themselves over cliffs or quicksand where they can easily be mistaken for lanterns (especially if they can set their traps near actual signal lanterns), allowing them to lure unwary travelers into perilous situations. On rare occasions, will-o'-wisps seeking easier pickings will move into a city and take up residence near gallows or follow along invisibly behind an army in order to harvest the fear of the dying men; why the vast majority choose to remain in the swamps where victims are scarce remains a mystery. Will-o'-wisps only use their electric shock ability under extreme duress, preferring to let other creatures or hazards claim their victims while they float nearby and feast.\n"
"Will-o'-wisps can glow any color they choose, but are most frequently yellow, white, green, or blue. They can even vary their luminosity to create patterns — many will-o'-wisps are fond of creating vague skull-like shapes in their glow to further terrify their victims.\n"
"Their actual bodies are barely visible globes of translucent spongy material 1 foot across and weighing 3 pounds, capable of emitting light from every surface.\n"
"A will-o'-wisp's light is approximately as bright as a torch, and though they do not seem to use sound to communicate with each other, they hear perfectly and can vibrate their bodies rapidly to simulate speech. While vilified by most other sentient creatures, will-o'-wisps are actually quite intelligent, if utterly alien in their reasoning. Sometimes organized into groups called \"strings,\" their society and goals remain complete unknowns to outsiders, as do their origins, though they have sometimes been known to strike bargains with those who can offer them vast quantities of appropriately frightened victims. As will-o'-wisps do not age, and are effectively immortal unless killed by violence, particularly ancient will-o'-wisps can serve as fantastic repositories of knowledge from the ancient past, although convincing one of these cruel creatures to cooperate with an interrogation can be a trick in and of itself."

"Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible — such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.\n"
"<b>Role</b>: While universalist wizards might study to prepare themselves for any manner of danger, specialist wizards research schools of magic that make them exceptionally skilled within a specific focus. Yet no matter their specialty, all wizards are masters of the impossible and can aid their allies in overcoming any danger.\n"
"<b>Alignment:</b> Any\n"
"<b>Hit Die:</b> d6\n"
"<b>Skill Ranks per Level:</b> 1 + Int modifier\n"
"<b>Base Features</b>\n"
"<b>Wizard Proficiencies</b>\n"
"Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a wizard's movements, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.\n"
"<b>Arcane Bond</b>\n"
"At 1st level, wizards form a powerful bond with an object or a creature. This bond can take one of two forms: a familiar or a bonded object.\n"
"<b>Cantrips</b>\n"
"Wizards can cast a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.\n"
"<b>Specialist School</b>\n"
"A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic, gaining additional spells and powers based on that school. This choice must be made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. A wizard that does not select a school receives the universalist school instead.\n"
"Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard can prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This spell must be in the wizard's spellbook. A wizard can select a spell modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot, but it uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the universalist school do not receive a school slot.\n"
"<b>Opposition School</b>\n"
"A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery in another. A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell.\n"
"<b>Wizard Bonus Feat</b>\n"
"At 1st, 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose a metamagic feat, spell focus feat or any other spellcaster feat. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.\n"
"<b>Selectable Features</b>\n"
"<b>Specialist Schools:</b>\n"
"<b>Specialist School – Conjuration</b>\n"
"The conjurer focuses on the study of summoning monsters and magic alike to bend to his will.\n"
"<b>Summoner's Charm</b>\n"
"Whenever you cast a conjuration (summoning) spell, increase the duration by a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). This increase is not doubled by Extend Spell. At 20th level, you can change the duration of all summon monster spells to permanent. You can have no more than one summon monster spell made permanent in this way at one time. If you designate another summon monster spell as permanent, the previous spell immediately ends.\n"
"<b>Acid Dart</b>\n"
"As a standard action you can unleash an acid dart targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The acid dart deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. This attack ignores spell resistance.\n"
"<b>Dimensional Steps</b>\n"
"At 8th level, you can use this ability to teleport up to 30 feet per wizard level per day as a standard action. This teleportation must be used in 5-foot increments and such movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You can bring other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each additional creature brought with you.\n"
"<b>Specialist School – Evocation</b>\n"
"Evokers revel in the raw power of magic, and can use it to create and destroy with shocking ease.\n"
"<b>Intense Spells</b>\n"
"Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals hit point damage, add 1/2 your wizard level to the damage (minimum +1). This bonus only applies once to a spell, not once per missile or ray, and cannot be split between multiple missiles or rays. This bonus damage is not increased by Empower Spell or similar effects. This damage is of the same type as the spell. At 20th level, whenever you cast an evocation spell you can roll twice to penetrate a creature's spell resistance and take the better result.\n"
"<b>Force Missile</b>\n"
"As a standard action you can unleash a force missile that automatically strikes a foe, as magic missile. The force missile deals 1d4 points of damage plus the damage from your intense spells evocation power. This is a force effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.\n"
"<b> Elemental Wall</b>\n"
"At 8th level, you can create a wall of energy that lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

"<b>Power over Undead</b>\n"
"You receive Turn Undead as a bonus feat. You can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier, but only to use the selected feat. The DC to save against these feats is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Charisma modifier. At 20th level, undead cannot add their channel resistance to the save against this ability.\n"

"Wyverns are nasty, brutish, and violent reptilian beasts akin to more powerful dragons. They are always aggressive and impatient, and are quick to resort to force in order to accomplish their goals. For this reason, dragons generally look down upon wyverns, considering their distant cousins nothing more than primitive savages with a distinct lack of style or wit. In most cases, this generalization is spot-on. Although far from animalistic in intellect, and capable of speech, most wyverns simply can't be bothered with the subtlety of diplomacy, and prefer to fight first and parley later, and even then only if faced with a foe they can neither defeat nor flee from.\n"
"Wyverns are territorial creatures. Though they occasionally hunt in small groups for large prey, they are generally solitary creatures, hunting in areas ranging in size from 100 to 200 square miles. Wyverns have been known to fight to the death among themselves for the right to hunt a territory rich with prey.\n"
"Although constantly hungry and prone to mayhem, a wyvern that can be befriended (usually through a delicate combination of flattery, intimidation, food, and treasure) becomes a powerful ally. They often serve giants and monstrous humanoids as guardians, and some lizardfolk and boggard tribes even use them as mounts, although such arrangements are quite costly in terms of food and gold, for few are the wyverns who would willingly serve as steeds for lesser creatures for long.\n"
"A wyvern is about 16 feet in length, half of which is tail. The average wyvern weighs 2,000 pounds."

"Zombies are unthinking automatons, and can do little more than follow orders. When left unattended, zombies tend to mill about in search of living creatures to slaughter and devour. Zombies attack until destroyed, having no regard for their own safety.\n"
"Although capable of following orders, zombies are more often unleashed into an area with no command other than to kill living creatures. As a result, zombies are often encountered in packs, wandering around places the living frequent, looking for victims."

msgid ""
"Zon-Kuthon is a twisted, cruel, jealous god who defiles flesh to bring pain and misery. He represents ever-present pain, emotional darkness, consuming envy, and debilitating loss. Unrepentantly evil, he finds only brief joy in the pain he causes others. His very existence is a corruption and parasite upon the world. His alien mind constantly seeks new ways to oppress, humiliate, demoralize, and destroy others. While his true goals are incomprehensible, his stated desire is to flay every living thing until the entire world is an intertwined mass of bleeding flesh writhing in pain-wracked ecstasy. He whips the minds of serial killers, guides the hands of torturers, and plays the nerves of the suffering like a master bard.\n"
"Zon-Kuthon offers no great wisdoms, no promises of universal truth, no guarantee of rewards in the afterlife. His strange mind sees little difference between this life and the next, and he tortures living flesh and dead souls alike with hideous pleasure and delicious pain. It's possible that this bleak nihilism may be part of some more elaborate master plan incomprehensible to even his greatest priests, but so far the method and message is that existence itself is pain. His faith is lawful, following the natural hierarchy of the strong preying upon the weak, whether for food, entertainment, sex, or proof of dominance.\n"
"Zon-Kuthon's direct intervention in the lives of mortals is usually brief and ambiguous, with the price often outweighing the benefit. A slave under the whip who prays for relief might experience sexual pleasure but find the pain is heightened. A craftsman who seeks perfection in his work achieves it only after his obsession drives away all he loves. A count who prays for help against invading orcs may gain the help of a cruel warlord who takes over the orc lands as his own and becomes an even greater menace. Despite these hidden poisons, depraved or despairing mortals continue to pray to Zon-Kuthon for help, and he has countless minions devoted to listening for these requests, watchful for those who might be tempted by the Dark Prince's umbral embrace.\n"
"Zon-Kuthon's true appearance varies, and there is no consistent depiction of him, but the overall image is easily recognizable. His flesh is pale and bloodless and usually hairless, though he sometimes has wispy blond hair on his scalp. Contrasting with the pale skin are bloody red wounds, many of which are held open with hooks, straps, or splints, some appearing partially healed and reopened. Sometimes his skin is completely gone in places, revealing bare muscle or even bone. He frequently has piercings, sometimes through muscle and bone, with bits of jewelry or remnants of his victims dangling from them. Even his face doesn't escape this attention, with spikes and hooked straps pulling it into strange configurations, his lips removed to show bloody teeth, one eye removed and replaced with a strange crystal, or the entire back of his head gone, revealing skull and brains. He is usually shown wearing a vertical metal crown that pulls his flesh back into an obscene sunburst halo. Parts of his body that lack wounds are usually covered in blood-soaked black leather, often sexualized or used to manipulate the wounds in an obscene manner. Absent this orchestra of mutilation, Zon-Kuthon might appear human, but brief glimpses of his unaltered parts set the maimings into sharp, horrifying contrast. Mortal representations of him are usually simplified to a pale man in black with one significant wound. Different cults of the church may venerate one version of his image over others (going so far as to duplicate that image in their own flesh), but these cosmetic differences are irrelevant in the faith's pursuit of pain and darkness.\n"
"Zon-Kuthon's favored weapon is the spiked chain, a versatile tool both in battle and in the deepest dungeon, and as a result his symbol is a skull with a spiked chain threaded through the eye sockets. Most of his priests are clerics, but there are several orders of corrupted paladins who inflict pain in his name, and certain primitive tribes worship him under the tutelage of adepts. In Nidal, where the church of Zon-Kuthon is the state religion, the clergy are often shadowcallers, government agents raised to the worship of Zon-Kuthon since childhood and trained to use both arcane and divine magic in his service. Zon-Kuthon is called the Midnight Lord and the Dark Prince. His most recognizable servants are erinyes, kytons, and hellcats comprised of unfathomable darkness.\n"
